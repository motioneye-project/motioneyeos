2011.02-rc1, Released February 14th, 2011:

	Fixes all over the tree and new features.

	External toolchain improvements: clarification of the options,
	and introduction of the toolchain profile concept, for
	well-known toolchains. Buildroot is now capable of
	automatically downloading and extracting well-known toolchains
	(for the moment, CodeSourcery ARM, PowerPC, MIPS and SuperH
	toolchains are supported). Crosstool-NG backend updated and
	improved.

	Complete rework of how hardware boards are supported.
	Each board now only has a single defconfig file, and all
	board-specific options have been removed. See
	docs/buildroot.html#board_support for details.

	Added support for the following boards: Mini2440, Qemu ARM
	Versatile, Qemu MIPSel Malta, Qemu PowerPC G3beige, Qemu SH4
	r2d and Qemu x86. The Qemu boards support allows to easily
	build systems that are known to work under Qemu.

	Initial support for Blackfin processors.

	Staging directory moved into $(O)/host/usr/<tuple>/sysroot, in
	preparation for support of SDK. For the same reason, the
	toolchain binaries (cross-compiler and other related tools)
	are now installed in $(O)/host/usr/bin/. The cross pkg-config
	now also automatically returns correct values for cross
	compilation, without needing any environment variables to be
	set.

	Ccache support reworked. Now used for both host and target
	compilation, and cache is stored in ~/.buildroot-ccache.

	Toolchain: uClibc 0.9.32-rc2, several components moved to
	normal AUTOTARGET packages.

	Generic cmake infrastructure, similar to the existing
	GENTARGETS/AUTOTARGETS.

	Support for bzr downloads, next to the existing git/svn support.

	Kconfig infrastructure rebased against 2.6.38-rc3, bringing
	misc fixes. 'xconfig' now uses Qt4 rather than Qt3.

	EXT2 file system size handling improved, UBI image support, fs
	configuration options cleanup, U-Boot/Barebox version bumps.

	Updated/fixed packages: alsa-utils, at, autoconf, automake,
	bash, binutils, bison, busybox, bzip2, cdrkit, cloop, cmake,
