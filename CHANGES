2017.11-rc1, To be released

	libssh2: there is now an explicit choice of the backend to use
	(mbedtls, gnutls or openssl). Previously, the choice was implicit
	based on the TLS library that was selected. Now, it is possible to
	choose the backend, which is important if several TLS libraries are
	selected. The default is mbedtls, even if you didn't have mbedtls
	selected before.

	netsnmp: all MIB files are now installed, making the target filesystem a
	bit bigger than before. To remove unneeded MIBS, you should use a
	post-build script.

	#10221: Buildroot Support

2017.08-rc1, Released August 2nd, 2017

	Infrastructure:

	- The skeleton package has been split into multiple packages:
	  skeleton-sysv (when Busybox or SysV init are used),
	  skeleton-systemd (when systemd is used), skeleton-none (when
	  no init system is used) and skeleton-custom (when a custom
	  skeleton is used). Those packages, except skeleton-custom,
	  share common logic and data in a new package called
	  skeleton-common. The skeleton package becomes a virtual
	  package. This change allows to generate a filesystem that is
	  compliant with systemd expectations.

	- Support for using a read-only filesystem with systemd has
	  been fixed.

	- Major revamp of the gettext handling, with user-visible
	  effect:

	  - prior to this revamp, when BR2_ENABLE_LOCALE=y, each
	    package could decide to enable or not NLS support. When
	    BR2_ENABLE_LOCALE was disabled, NLS support was forced off
	    by passing --disable-nls to packages.

	  - after this revamp, a new BR2_SYSTEM_ENABLE_NLS option
	    controls whether NLS support should be enabled or not in
	    packages. This option defaults to disabled, which means
	    that now, NLS support is by default disabled in all
	    packages.

	  Therefore, if you need NLS support in packages, you must now
	  explicitly enable the BR2_SYSTEM_ENABLE_NLS option.

	- The host directory no longer has a usr/ component. This
	  makes it much more natural to use that directory as an
	  externally used toolchain. For compatibility with existing
	  scripts, a usr -> . link is still added.

	- Hashes are now checked on tarballs by Buildroot when a
	  package is sourced from a Git repository.

	- Patches are no longer being downloaded from Github, since
	  auto-generated patches could change over time, and break
	  hashes. All patches that were downloaded from Github are now
	  stored in their respective package directories.

	- Hash files in packages can now contain hashes for the
	  license files contained in the package source code. This
	  allows to detect changes in such license files.

	- Binaries in $(TARGET_DIR) are now cleaned up from invalid
	  RPATHs at the end of the build.

	- A new "make sdk" target prepares $(HOST_DIR) to be
	  relocatable: turns RPATHs in host binaries into relocatable
	  ones, removes bogus RPATHs from staging binaries/libraries,
	  and provides a relocate-sdk script that can be executed to
	  relocate the SDK after installation.

	- Addition of utils/genrandconfig which generates a random
	  configuration based on a set of pre-defined toolchain
	  configurations (support/config-fragments/autobuild/) and a
	  random selection of packages. It is now used by the
	  autobuilders to generate the random configurations.

	Filesystems:

	- ext2/3/4 filesystems are now generated using mkfs.ext from
	  e2fsprogs instead of using genext2fs.

	Architecture:

	- Addition of support for ARM big.LITTLE variants
	- Improved MIPS support, with options to select NaN encoding
	  and FP32 mode.

	Toolchain:

	- Switch to gcc 6.x as the default gcc version, add support
	  for gcc 7.x, remove support for gcc 4.8
	- Switch to binutils 2.28 as the default binutils version, add
	  support for binutils 2.29, remove support for binutils 2.26
	- Support added for gdb 8.0
	- uClibc-ng bumped to 1.0.26
	- CodeSourcery toolchains for x86 and SuperH have been
	  removed, they were using a too old glibc version
	  (2.17). External toolchains with glibc 2.17 or earlier are
	  no longer supported.
	- The version selection in the glibc package has been
	  removed. Like musl and uClibc-ng, we now use the latest
	  glibc version.
	- Improved support for Xtensa toolchain overlays, which can
	  now be downloaded.

	Tools:

	- Numerous improvements to the runtime test infrastructure
	- Tests are now executed by Gitlab CI on a regular basis
	- Tools that are directly useful to the user have been moved
	  from support/scripts/ to utils/: brmake, check-package,
	  get-developers, scancpan, scanpipy, size-stats-compare,
	  test-pkg.

	New defconfigs: A13 Olinuxino, Engicam platforms (i.CoreM6
	Solo/Dual/DualLite/Quad, RQS SOM, GEAM6UL SOM, Is.IoT MX6UL
	SOM), Nano Pi M1 (Plus), OrangePi Zero and Plus.

	#9796: source-check broken for Git downloads
	#9866: BASE_DIR usage

2017.05-rc1, Released May 8th, 2017

	Fixes all over the tree and new features.

	Infrastructure:

	- Installed binaries are now checked for correct architecture
	  to catch natively built binaries or binaries built for other
	  architecture variants.

	- Luarocks infrastructure improvements to extraction handling,
	  support for upstream name != Buildroot package name.

	- 'make printvars' output format has changed to make it easier
	  to use in scripts. It now has options to quote the variables
	  and to show the expanded/unexpanded values.

	- Automatic ext2 rootfs size calculation has been removed. The
	  logic was not working working reliable in all setups as it
	  depends on the host filesystem behaviour, so instead now the
	  size has to be specified explicitly (defaults to 60MB).

	- The git download infrastructure now ensures that GNU format
	  tar files are created.

	- Fixed a variable clashing issue in the mkusers script with
	  internal bash variables.

	- Fakeroot now links against libacl to fix issues on
	  distributions using acls.

	- Correct permissions for /dev/pts/ptmx when systemd is used
	  with recent glibc versions.

	- br2-external: Improve error reporting.

	- A wrapper script for genimage has been added in
	  support/scripts/genimage.sh for easy use of genimage from
	  post-image scripts.

	- A script to check for common style issues in new packages
	  before submitting has been added in support/scripts/check-package

	- Defconfigs are now tested by gitlab-CI instead of Travis:
	  https://gitlab.com/buildroot.org/buildroot

	- Infrastructure for runtime testing has been added to
          support/testing

	Toolchain:

	- External linaro toolchains updated to 2017.02, ARC toolchain
          updated to 2017.03-rc1, NIOSII CodeSourcery to 2017.05

	- A number of fixes and improvements to the external toolchain
	  handling, including C library detection, multilib and ld.so
	  handling

	- Glibc 2.25 and uClibc-ng 1.0.24 added, wordexp support enabled
          for uClibc-ng

	- Binutils 2.28 added and default changed to 2.27


	Architectures:

	- Support for the C-SKY architecture has been added.


	License handling:

	- The package license markings for legal info now uses the
	  SPDX short identifiers for the license string where possible.

	- License info has been improved / added for a number of packages.


	Misc:

	- Cmake 3.7.x installed on the host is no longer ignored as a
          workaround for the RPATH issues has been implemented.

	- Docker-engine can now be built statically on an otherwise
	  dynamic linked build for docker-in-docker setups.

	- U-Boot now supports out-of-tree device trees, similar to
          Linux

	- Nodejs 0.10.x support (and with it, support for <ARMv6) has
          been removed as this is now EOL upstream.

	New defconfigs: AT91sam9x5ek dev/mmc/mmc-dev, banana pro,
	Nationalchip gx6605s, MIPS creator ci40, nexbox a95x, 64bit
	defconfig for raspberry pi 3, stm32f429-disc1.

	The raspberry pi zero-w and rpi3 compute module are now also
	supported by the rpi0 / rpi3 defconfigs, beaglebone green is
	supported by the beaglebone defconfig.

2016.11-rc3, Released November 28th, 2016

	Fixes all over the tree, including a number of security fixes.

	The move from fakeroot to pseudo unfortunately brought a
	number of issues.  The SELinux issue described in #9386 which
	triggered the move to pseudo has been investigated further and
	a workaround implemented and the pseudo changes reverted.

	Linux kernel: update default to 4.8.11.

	Defconfigs: Updates/fixes for imx28ek, mx6udoo, imx6ulpico,

2016.11-rc2, Released November 13th, 2016

	Fixes all over the tree.

	strace, openjpeg, lcms2, quota.

	Linux kernel: update default to 4.8.7.

	CMake support: fix cmake wrapper to properly pass NDEBUG flag.

	Filesystems: use a wrapper to pseudo, to better mimick the behaviour
	of fakeroot; makedevs no longer breaks of the destination already
	exists and is of the correct type/major/minor.

	Defconfigs: a few legacy and broken defconfigs have been removed
	because they now fail to build: kb9202_defconfig, mini2440_defconfig,
	freescale_p2020ds, qmx6, calao*, atmel_sama5d4ek. Other defconfigs
	have been updated: nanopi-neo, olimex_a20_olinuxino_lime_mali,
	armadeus_apf51, armadeus_apf28, freescale_imx31_3stack, ci20,
	olimex_a20_olinuxino_lime2, atmel_at91sam9260eknf,
	atmel_at91sam9rlek, atmel_at91sam9g20dfc, atmel_at91sam9g45m10ek,
	atmel_sama5d3xek.

2016.11-rc1, Released November 3rd, 2016

	Fixes all over the tree and new features.

	It is now possible to specify multiple BR2_EXTERNAL
	directories. The required files in a BR2_EXTERNAL directory
	have changed to accomodate this feature. Refer to the
	documentation for details of how to update them. External
	trees now have a name and a description. Also, it is possible
	to override a defconfig in the external tree.

	The default skeleton now uses UID 65534 for the "nobody"
	user instead of UID 99, like most distros do. See
	https://lwn.net/Articles/695478/ for a complete discussion.
	Programs and configuration files that explicitly refer to UID
	99 will have to be updated.

	When the build environment already has a suitable cmake version
	(3.1 or later), that one will be used instead of building
	host-cmake. This can speed up the build significantly.

	The ExtUtils::MakeMaker perl module is now required in the
	build environment.

	An additional check is done during the build that files are
	not installed in the output directory within the output
	directory. This happens e.g. when the target directory is
	contained both in --prefix and in DESTDIR. The build will
	terminate with an error message that specifies which package
	and which file caused the failure.

	The concept of "deprecated packages" and the BR2_DEPRECATED
	option have been removed. Instead, packages are removed
	immediately. Packages are only removed when they don't work
	for some reason. If you still need a removed package and
	you have a solution for the problem(s) that caused the
	removal, please contribute it.

	Architecture: support for sh64 removed, improved support for
	MIPS core selection.

	Toolchain: support for musl powerpc64le, mips64 and mipsr6
	toolchains, ARC toolchain components updates, gcc 6.x series
	bumped to 6.2.0, default binutils version switched to 2.26,
	default gcc version switched to gcc 5.x, Linaro toolchains
	updated, uclibc-ng bumped to 1.0.19. GCC is now always built
	with TLS support. Checking of unsafe compiler options (that
	point to host directories) has been extended with -isystem,
	-idirafter and -iquote.

	Package infrastructure: new variable $(PKG)_DL_OPTS, addition
	of <pkg>-show-rdepends to list reverse dependencies, and
	<pkg>-graph-rdepends to graph reverse dependencies. Linux tools
	are now in a separate linux-tools package instead of in the
	kernel build. Fakeroot has been replaced by pseudo.

	CMake support: the toolchainfile.cmake file now provides a
	definition of the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE variable. The
	toolchainfile.cmake also no longer forces the compiler/linker
	flags defined by Buildroot.

	New defconfigs: WaRP7, Solidrun's MX6 Cubox/Hummingboard,
	TS-4900, Grinn's liteBoard, Udoo MX6Q/DL, Qemu ARM noMMU,
	BeagleBone Qt5 demo, Digilent Zybo, FriendlyARM Nanopi NEO.

	New packages: arm-trusted-firmware, amd-catalyst, atop, aufs,
	aufs-util, fwts, gst1-rtsp-server, libglob, libite, mfgtools,
	mksh, motion, paho-mqtt-c, php-amqp, pseudo, python-couchdb,
	python-crcmod, python-cssutils, python-docutils,
	python-futures, python-mwclient, python-mwscrape,
	python-mwscrape2slob, python-pyelftools, python-pyicu,
	python-pylru, python-pyqt5, python-requests-toolbelt,
	python-simpleaudio, python-slob, rabbitmq-server, shapelib,
	vdr, vdr-plugin-vnsiserver, vexpress-firmware, xvisor, iio and
	gpio linux tools.

	Removed packages: binutils 2.24, fakeroot, gcc 4.7, ipkg,
	kodi-addon-xvdr, libgail, sstrip, torsmo, webkit, webkitgtk24,
	wvdial, wvstreams.

	Documentation: the list of packages that was present in the
	Buildroot manual has been removed.

	Legal info: the "licenses.txt" file that concatenates all
	license texts is no longer generated - it was not considered
	useful. The manifest.csv contains an empty cell instead of
	"not saved" when no license file is available.

	Other: addition of a DEVELOPERS file listing developers taking
	care of packages or architectures.

2016.08-rc1, Released August 6th, 2016

	Fixes all over the tree and new features.

	Toolchain: Fortran support added. eglibc support removed, musl
	support no longer experimental. Blackfin and Microblaze
	support for internal uClibc-ng toolchain, m68k/coldfire
	improvements. The check for unsafe (build host) directories
	access (/usr/include and /usr/lib) is now enabled by default.
	Unused locales are now purged by default to save space (and
	the default list of locales shrunk). The option to control
	this has now moved from the toolchain menu to system
	configuration.

	Legal info improvements: sources are now hardlinked instead of
	copied if possible to save space. Patches and extra downloads
	are also saved.

	An experimental configuration knob (BR2_REPRODUCIBLE) has been
	added to make the builds more reproducible (E.G. less
	differences in the binary output between builds of the same
	configuration). This is still work in progress.

	An option to execute a custom script inside the fakeroot
	environment used to the generate the filesystem (E.G. to tweak
	permissions or similar) has been added.

	Git support now supports git submodules if
	<pkg>_GIT_SUBMODULES is enabled.

	Hash files for integritry validation have been added for all
	packages.

	Scanpypi utility to help creating packages from the Python
	package index (pypi) has been added.

	The makedevs utility now has support for adding file
	capabilities using extended attributes.

	New defconfigs: Arcturus uCP1020, Atmel sama5d{2,3,4} xplained
	development configs, Blackfin GDB simulator, Linksprite

2015.11-rc1, Released November, 7th 2015

	Fixes all over the tree and new features.

	Architectures:

	- Support for sparc64 added (internal toolchain with glibc
	  only).

	- Support for mips32r6 and mips64r6 added.

	- Support for Intel Quark X1000 CPU.

	- Switch to EABIhf by default on ARM when a VFP is available.

	Toolchains:

	- glibc 2.22, gdb 7.10, use gdb 7.9 by default, musl 1.1.12,
	  uclibc-ng 1.0.8, host-gdb enabled on AArch64.

	- The toolchain wrapper which was used only for external
	  toolchains is now also used for Buildroot internal
	  toolchains. This allowed to fix the ccache support, prepare
	  the way for top-level parallel build support and remove gcc
	  patches used to detect header/library path poisoning.

	- Remove Analog Devices Blackfin toolchain 2012R2.

	- Fix several Xtensa build failures by switching from
	  text-section-literals to auto-litpools.

	- Enable MIPS64 support in uClibc-ng, use uClibc on ARC
	  rather than a specific fork.

	- Linaro toolchains for ARM, ARMeb and AArch64 updated to
	  2015.08. 2014.09 version is kept since 2015.08 only runs on
	  x86_64 hosts.

	Bootloaders:

	- Fix ARM64 support in U-Boot.

	Defconfigs:

	- Added: ARC HS38 VDK virtual boards, Avnet Microzed, Boundary
	  Devices Nitrogen SoloX, Freescale i.MX6 SoloX Sabre SD,
	  OLinuxino A20 Lime2, Qemu Sparc64, Qemu SuperH 4 big endian,
	  Synopsys AArch64 VDK virtual platform.

	- Updated: calao_qil_a9260, calao_usb_a9g20_lpw, ci20,
	  cubieboad, freescale_imx6_*, imx53loco, imx6_vab820,
	  mpc8315erdb, qmx6, p1010rdb, qemu, raspberrypi,
	  raspberrypi2, riotboard, snps_axs10*, wandboard.

	- Removed: at91rm9200df, at91sam9260dfc, at91sam9263ek,
	  calao_snowball_defconfig, gnublin, integrator926_defconfig.

	Infrastructure:

	- Support for fetching from Mercurial tags fixed.

	- Introduce LINUX_NEEDS_MODULES, which allows to enforce
	  module support to be enabled in the kernel when a package
	  builds out-of-tree kernel modules (through the
	  pkg-kernel-module infrastructure or on its own).

	- Improve the perl package infrastructure to automatically add
	  the dependency to the perl interpreter to target perl module
	  packages.

	- Remove trailing slashes in <pkg>_SITE and addition of a
	  check to ensure such trailing slashes are no longer added.

	- Extend the legal infrastructure to allow packages to declare
	  their actual source code. This is useful for packages for
	  which <pkg>_SOURCE points to pre-built binaries (as is the
	  case for external toolchains). The new <pkg>_ACTUAL_SOURCE
	  variable allows to point to the source code in such cases.

	- Improved ccache support, thanks to the usage of a toolchain
	  wrapper for internal toolchain. Now a single cache directory
	  can be shared between different Buildroot builds.

	- Addition of a 'graph-size' make targets, which generates a
	  PDF graph of per-package size of the root filesystem.

	- Addition of <pkg>_EXCLUDES so that packages can request
	  certain parts of the source code tarball to not be
	  extracted. This feature is currently used by gcc and
	  toolchain-external.

	- Packages can now use the <pkg>_PKGDIR variable, provided by
	  the package infrastructure, to reference their package
	  directory, instead of explicitly using package/<pkg>/.

	Filesystems:

	- Add high lz4 compression to squashfs.

	- Simplification of shell profile files in the default
	  skeleton.

	- Remove ftp user and /home/ftp from the skeleton, and let ftp
	  server packages create these when needed.

	- Add support for /bin, /sbin and /lib to be symlinks to their
	  corresponding directories in /usr. This is enforced for
	  systemd configurations, and optional for other
	  configurations.

	- Support for AXFS filesystem image generation added.

	- New options to add extra space/inodes to ext2/3/4 images.

2015.08-rc1, Released August, 5th 2015

	Fixes all over the tree and new features.

	Architectures:

	 - Refactor how the availability of an MMU is described.
	 - Minimal support for Cortex-M3
	 - Minimal support for AArch64 big-endian

	Toolchains:

	 - Add CodeSourcery MIPS 2015.05, remove MIPS 2013.11
	 - Use uClibc-ng as the default uClibc version, instead of the
	   official uClibc, which hasn't done any release since 3+
	   years
	 - eglibc is now marked as deprecated
	 - GCC: gcc 4.9.x is now the default and was updated to 4.9.3,
	   support for gcc 5.x added.
	 - Binutils: use Binutils 2.24 as the default, 2.25.x series
	   bumped to 2.25.1, remove old Binutils 2.22.
	 - Update ARC toolchain components to 2015.06
	 - Add support for Fortran when building gcc

	Bootloaders:

	 - Support for using the kconfig configuration system in
	   U-Boot

	New Defconfigs:

	 - VIA VAB-820/AMOS-820
	 - OLimex OLinuxino A20 Lime
	 - Many new defconfigs for Atmel evaluation boards:
	   at91sam9rlek, at91sam9x5ek, sama5d3xek, sama5d4ek, sama5d4
	   Xplained Ultra, sama5d3 Xplained.
	 - ACME Systems Aria G25
	 - WarPboard
	 - Altera Cyclone 5 Development Board
	 - Xilinx zc706
	 - ARC AXS101 and AXS103 Software Development Platforms
	 - Significant updates to Raspberry Pi / Raspberry Pi 2

	Infrastructure:

	 - Buildroot takes better care now of generating predictable
	   permissions in the target filesystem. However, existing
	   permissions on a custom skeleton or rootfs overlay will no
	   longer be preserved. Therefore, it is necessary to add a
	   permission table (BR2_ROOTFS_DEVICE_TABLE) to set the
	   required permissions.
	 - Add support for kconfig fragments.
	 - No longer pass --{enable,disable}-debug to autotools
	   packages depending on the value of
	   BR2_ENABLE_DEBUG. BR2_ENABLE_DEBUG now only controls
	   whether we build with -g or not.
	 - Support for extracting archives in .lzma in the generic
	   package infrastructure.
	 - Remove random-seed file from the default skeleton, since
	   seeding the entropy pool with a known seed makes more harm
	   than good.
	 - In the CVS download helper, add support to use a date as
	   the version.
	 - Add support for a per-package <pkg>_STRIP_COMPONENTS
	   variable, which packages can use to specify how many path
	   components should be stripped when extracting the tarball.
	 - Addition of a 'kernel-module' package infrastructure, which
	   simplifies the packaging of external kernel modules. Many
	   existing packages are converted to use it.
	 - Allow bootloaders to be implemented in $(BR2_EXTERNAL)
	 - Remove /etc/securetty from the default skeleton.
	 - Migration of sysV initscripts from the default skeleton to
	   a package called 'initscripts', installed only when Busbox
	   init or sysvinit are used.
	 - Migration of the skeleton logic to a proper 'skeleton'
	   package.
	 - Addition of a 'linux-tools' infrastructure in the 'linux'
	   package, to support building user-space tools bundled
	   within the Linux kernel sources, such as perf and cpupower.
	 - Usage of backticks instead of make $(shell ...) to execute
	   shell commands. This allows to delay the evaluation of such
	   commands when actually needed, and not when expanding the
	   variables. It is useful to make 'make printvars' less
	   noisy, and as a preparation to support top-level parallel
	   build.
	 - Libtool .la files are not mungled for all package types,
	   instead of being handled only for packages using the
	   autotools-package infrastructure.
	 - Add mechanism to allow packages to express a dependency on
	   gcc versions. This is needed for packages that use C++11 or
	   C11 support for example.

	Important package updates:

	 - Complete rework of the matchbox packaging
	 - Lots of fixes in packages for compatibility with musl and
	   gcc 5.
	 - Hash files added to a large number of packages.
	 - Update a significant number of packages to use a new
	   hosting, after the announcement of Google Code and
	   Gitorious closing.
	 - Major packages needed for SELinux support have been merged,
	   but the support is not complete yet.
	 - Significant update of OpenCV to version 3.0, and addition
	   of lots of eatures.
	 - Significant update of all packages supporting the GPU and
	   VPU of i.MX ARM processors.
	 - Addition of systemd support in a significant number of
	   packages.
	 - Qt5 updated to 5.5.0
	 - Use modular X.org server by default instead of KDrive

	Filesystems:

	 - Complete overhaul of the iso9660 support. Now allows to use
	   directly IS9660 as the root filesystem format and not only
	   an initrd, and supports Grub 2 and isolinux in addition to
	   Grub.

2015.05-rc1, Released May 4th, 2015

	Fixes all over the tree and new features.

	Architectures: Removed AVR32 support, deprecate SH64, added
	support for steamroller, corei7-avx and core-avx2 x86
	variants.

	Toolchains: IPv6 and Largefile support now enforced for
	uClibc. Corresponding Kconfig symbols removed.

	External CodeSourcery AMD64 2014.05, MUSL-cross 1.1.6 added,
	CS sh2, Xilinx microblaze v2/14.3 removed. Distro-class
	external toolchains are now detected and blacklisted.

	Internal toolchain support for Nios2 added, Blackfin
	removed. Aarch64 and sh musl support. uClibc-ng support added.

	Libatomic is now handled for internal and external
	toolchains. Link time optimization (LTO) support.

	New Defconfigs: Freescale i.MX28 EVK, i.MX31 PDK and SABRE
	Auto, Raspberry Pi 2, RIoTboard,

	Infrastructure: Hashes for a large number of packages have
	been added. Missing hashes now stop the build unless
	explicitly disabled.

	Spaces and colons (:) are now supported in package
	versions. Dependencies can now be listed for the patch step
	(<PKG>_PATCH_DEPENDENCIES). Kconfig and Linux kernel
	extensions infrastructure has been added.

	Makedevs now has a recursive (r) option.

	The variable containing the list of packages to build has been
	renamed from TARGETS to PACKAGES.

	Make external-deps / legal-info / source / source-check have
	been reimplemented using the package infrastructure, so their
	output/behaviour may differ from earlier (some packages were
	not included in the past).

	The old insecure DES password encoding is no longer supported.

	U-Boot patch option now support direct references to patch
	files and URLs in addition to directories of patches. The
	i.MX28 SD format (u-boot.sd) is now supported.

2015.02-rc1, Released February 8th, 2015

	Fixes all over the tree and new features.

	Static/shared library handling reworked. This is now a
	tristate (shared only / shared and static / static
	only). Default is now shared only to speed up the
	build. BR2_PREFER_STATIC_LIB is now called BR2_STATIC_LIBS.

	The toolchain (internal and external) will now warn when an
	unsafe library or header path is used (such as /usr/include or
	/usr/lib). If BR2_COMPILER_PARANOID_UNSAFE_PATH is enabled
	under build options this instead becomes an error.

	A installation path issue with the internal musl toolchain
	support has been fixed so it is now possible to reuse it as an
	external toolchain.

	Architectures: Freescale E5500 and E6500 PowerPC support
	added, deprecated MIPS 1/2/3/4 support removed.

	New defconfigs: Freescale p2020ds, MIPS creator CI20,
	Raspberrypi with DT, UDOO Quad.

	'make <foo>_defconfig' now saves the path to the defconfig in
	the .config, so a 'make savedefconfig' automatically updates
	it.

	Infrastructure for packages using the Erland rebar tool has
	been added.

	Hashes for a large number of packages have been added. Hashes
	are now checked for both target and host packages.

	The system menu now has an option to automatically configure a
	network interface through DHCP at bootup.

	The default filesystem skeleton now uses a separate tmpfs for
	/run instead of a symlink to /tmp/ for security reasons / to
	protect against conflicts with user generated temporary files.

	BR2_EXTERNAL is now exported to post-build and post-image
	scripts.

	New packages: bdwgc, benejson, blktrace, bootstrap, cgic,
	ding-libs, dvdauthor, ejabberd, erlang-goldrush, erlang-lager,

	additional ARC and sparc variants. Updated Code sourcery
	and Linaro external toolchains.

	Defconfigs: Freescale iMX6DL SabreSD, Minnowboard MAX, QEMU
	powerpc64 pseries added and a number of updates to the
	existing configurations.

	Infrastructure: Buildroot is now less noisy when built with
	the silent option (make -s).
	A number of package infrastructure variables have been renamed
	from *_OPT to *_OPTS for constency. Buildroot will complain if
	the old names are used to assist in updating out of tree
	packages.
	Fixes for host systems where bash isn't located in /bin, and
	older systems not supporting mktemp --tmpdir.
	Various cleanups of users/groups in the default skeleton.
	There is now an option to choose what shell /bin/sh points to.

	Fixes all over the tree.

	Stripping using sstrip has been deprecated.

	BR2_EXTERNAL can now also be used to implement custom
	filesystem types.

	The newly added BR2_GRAPH_DEPTH variable to limit the depth of

	BR2_GRAPH_DEPS_OPTS, so additional options can be supported in
	the future.

	The virtual package infrastructure will now error out early
	if multiple packages providing the same virtual package has
	been enabled (E.G. opengl). This change requires that the
	packages explicitly declare what virtual package(s) they
	provide.

2014.05-rc1, Released May 13th, 2014

	Fixes all over the tree and new features.

	Architectures: Support for MIPS o32 ABI on MIPS-64 targets has
	been removed. Building o32 ELF files for MIPS64 is an exotic
	configuration that nobody should be using. If o32 is required,
	then is better if it's built for MIPS 32-bit cores so only
	32-bit instructions will be used leading to a more efficient
	o32 usage.
	Support for the ARM A12 variant and Intel corei7.

	Configs: Minnowboard and Altera SoCkit added, QEMU updates.

	Bootloaders: Grub2 and gummiboot support, syslinux support
	extended.

	Toolchains: GCC 4.9. Glibc 2.19. Support for the musl C
	library for internal and external toolchains. 4.8-R3 support
	for ARC, Internal toolchain support for Aarch64 and
	Microblaze. Environment variable to control debug output of
	toolchain wrapper renamed to BR2_DEBUG_WRAPPER to match the
	other variables. Toolchain tuple vendor name can now be
	customized. Updated external Linaro ARM/Aarch64
	toolchains. Added external Linaro ARMEB toolchain.
	A GDB gdbinit file is now generated for external toolchains to
	automatically set the correct sysroot.

	Kconfig handling for minimum kernel headers version required
	for packages. Now packages needing specific kernel header
	features can specify these requirements in Kconfig.

	Infrastructure: Support for (but disabled as it leads to
	unreproducible builds) toplevel parallel builds. See the
	comment at the top of Makefile for details about how to enable
	it and what the problems are if you want to test it.
	Python package infrastructure extended to support Python 3.x
	Perl and virtual package infrastructure support added.
	PRE_*_HOOKS support for all build steps.

2012.08-rc1, Released August 1st, 2012

	Fixes all over the tree and new features.

	Integration of a legal information reporting infrastructure,

	licenses and source code of all components of a system
	generated by Buildroot. License information will progressively
	be added on packages.

	Default configuration files added for Calao-systems USB-A9263
	and Calao-systems USB-A9G20-LPW.

	External toolchains update: allow download of a custom
	toolchain, add Linaro 2012.05 and 2012.06 for ARM, add
	Blackfin toolchain 2012R1-BETA1, add Sourcery CodeBench MIPS
	2011.09.

	Allow the restriction of downloads to the primary site only.
        This is useful for project developers who want to ensure that
        the project can be built even if the upstream tarball
        locations disappear.

	Add a 'System configuration' choice to select between 3
	different init systems: Busybox init, SysV init and Systemd
	init.

	Cleanups to the package infrastructure. The visible change to
	developers is that $(eval $(call AUTOTARGETS)) is now $(eval
	$(autotools-package)), and similarly for other package
	infrastructures and host packages. Refer to the documentation
	for details.

	By default, automatic detection of the number of compilation
	jobs to use, depending on the number of CPUs available.

	Improvements to generate systems with static libraries only
	(infrastructure and package fixes).

	Add proper support in the Linux kernel package to generate
	Device Tree Blobs or combined Device Tree / Kernel
	images. This will be useful on Microblaze, PowerPC and ARM,
	which are architectures making extensive use of the Device
	Tree.

2011.05-rc1, Released May 18th, 2011:

	Fixes all over the tree and new features.

	External toolchain improvements: We now build a binary
	toolchain wrapper and install it into HOST_DIR/usr/bin, which
	enforces the correct compiler arguments, making an external
	toolchain as easy to use outside of Buildroot as the internal
	ones are. This also brought a cleanup of CFLAGS, making the
	Buildroot build output easier to read.

	Rootfs device handling improvements: Choice between static
	/dev, devtmpfs and devtmpfs with either mdev or udev.

	Toolchain: More preconfigured codesourcery external
	toolchains, improved Crosstool-NG support, fix for GCC
	snapshot versions, GCC 4.4.6 / 4.5.3, experimental GCC 4.6.0
	support, target-GCC fixes, uClibc fixes, 0.9.32-rc3 support.

	Bootloaders: U-boot 2011.03, Barebox 2011.05.0

	Linux: support for custom kernel image targets, E.G. for
	powerpc builds with embedded device trees.

	terminal setup out of the box.

	Misc gentarget / autotools handling fixes.

2011.02-rc1, Released February 14th, 2011:

	Fixes all over the tree and new features.

	External toolchain improvements: clarification of the options,
	and introduction of the toolchain profile concept, for
	well-known toolchains. Buildroot is now capable of
	automatically downloading and extracting well-known toolchains
	(for the moment, CodeSourcery ARM, PowerPC, MIPS and SuperH
	toolchains are supported). Crosstool-NG backend updated and
	improved.

	Complete rework of how hardware boards are supported.
	Each board now only has a single defconfig file, and all
	board-specific options have been removed. See
	docs/buildroot.html#board_support for details.

	Added support for the following boards: Mini2440, Qemu ARM
	Versatile, Qemu MIPSel Malta, Qemu PowerPC G3beige, Qemu SH4
	r2d and Qemu x86. The Qemu boards support allows to easily
	build systems that are known to work under Qemu.

	Initial support for Blackfin processors.

	Staging directory moved into $(O)/host/usr/<tuple>/sysroot, in
	preparation for support of SDK. For the same reason, the
	toolchain binaries (cross-compiler and other related tools)
	are now installed in $(O)/host/usr/bin/. The cross pkg-config
	now also automatically returns correct values for cross
	compilation, without needing any environment variables to be
	set.

	Ccache support reworked. Now used for both host and target
	compilation, and cache is stored in ~/.buildroot-ccache.

	Toolchain: uClibc 0.9.32-rc2, several components moved to
	normal AUTOTARGET packages.

	Generic cmake infrastructure, similar to the existing
	GENTARGETS/AUTOTARGETS.

	Support for bzr downloads, next to the existing git/svn support.

	Kconfig infrastructure rebased against 2.6.38-rc3, bringing
	misc fixes. 'xconfig' now uses Qt4 rather than Qt3.

	EXT2 file system size handling improved, UBI image support, fs
	configuration options cleanup, U-Boot/Barebox version bumps.

	Updated/fixed packages: alsa-utils, at, autoconf, automake,
	bash, binutils, bison, busybox, bzip2, cdrkit, cloop, cmake,
