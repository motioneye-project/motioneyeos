	  contents when the compiler changes in an incompatible
	  way. Therefore, if you make a change to the compiler version
	  and/or configuration, you are responsible for purging the

config BR2_OPTIMIZE_1
	bool "optimization level 1"
	help
	  Optimize. Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time,
	  and a lot more memory for a large function. With -O, the
	  compiler tries to reduce code size and execution time,
	  without performing any optimizations that take a great deal
	  of compilation time. -O turns on the following optimization
	  flags: -fdefer-pop -fdelayed-branch -fguess-branch-probability
	  -fcprop-registers -floop-optimize -fif-conversion
	  -fif-conversion2 -ftree-ccp -ftree-dce -ftree-dominator-opts

	  -ftree-fre -ftree-ch -funit-at-a-time -fmerge-constants
	  -O also turns on -fomit-frame-pointer on machines where doing
	  so does not interfere with debugging.

config BR2_OPTIMIZE_2
	bool "optimization level 2"
	help
	  Optimize even more. GCC performs nearly all supported optimizations
	  that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff. The compiler does not
	  perform loop unrolling or function inlining when you specify -O2.
	  As compared to -O, this option increases both compilation time and
	  the performance of the generated code. -O2 turns on all optimization
	  flags specified by -O. It also turns on the following optimization
	  flags: -fthread-jumps -fcrossjumping -foptimize-sibling-calls
	  -fcse-follow-jumps -fcse-skip-blocks -fgcse  -fgcse-lm
	  -fexpensive-optimizations -fstrength-reduce -frerun-cse-after-loop

	  Please note the warning under -fgcse about invoking -O2 on programs
	  that use computed gotos.

config BR2_OPTIMIZE_3
	bool "optimization level 3"
	help
	  Optimize yet more. -O3 turns on all optimizations specified by -O2
	  and also turns on the -finline-functions, -funswitch-loops and
	  -fgcse-after-reload options.

config BR2_OPTIMIZE_S
	bool "optimize for size"
	help
	  Optimize for size. -Os enables all -O2 optimizations that do not
	  typically increase code size. It also performs further optimizations
	  designed to reduce code size. -Os disables the following optimization
	  flags: -falign-functions -falign-jumps -falign-loops -falign-labels

	  A package override file is a short makefile that contains

	  Otherwise, if the directory $(BR2_GLOBAL_PATCH_DIR)/<packagename> exists,
