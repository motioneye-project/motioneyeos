	  Optimize. Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time,
	  and a lot more memory for a large function. With -O, the

	  Optimize even more. GCC performs nearly all supported optimizations
	  that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff. The compiler does not
	  perform loop unrolling or function inlining when you specify -O2.
	  As compared to -O, this option increases both compilation time and
	  the performance of the generated code. -O2 turns on all optimization
	  flags specified by -O. It also turns on the following optimization
	  flags: -fthread-jumps -fcrossjumping -foptimize-sibling-calls
