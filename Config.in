	  Note that Buildroot does not try to invalidate the cache
	  contents when the compiler changes in an incompatible way.
	  Therefore, if you make a change to the compiler version and/or
	  configuration, you are responsible for purging the ccache
	  cache by removing the $HOME/.buildroot-ccache directory.

	  For example, if your project is known to require more space
	  than the default max cache size, then you might want to
	  increase the cache size to a suitable amount using the -M
	  (--max-size) option.

	  The string you specify here is passed verbatim to ccache.
	  Refer to ccache documentation for more details.

	  These initial settings are applied after ccache has been

config BR2_CCACHE_USE_BASEDIR
	bool "Use relative paths"
	default y
	help
	  Allow ccache to convert absolute paths within the output
	  directory into relative paths.

	  During the build, many -I include directives are given with an
	  absolute path. These absolute paths end up in the hashes that
	  are computed by ccache. Therefore, when you build from a
	  different directory, the hash will be different and the cached
	  object will not be used.

	  To improve cache performance, set this option to y. This
	  allows ccache to rewrite absolute paths within the output
	  directory into relative paths. Note that only paths within the
	  output directory will be rewritten; therefore, if you change
	  BR2_HOST_DIR to point outside the output directory and
	  subsequently move it to a different location, this will lead
	  to cache misses.

	  This option has as a result that the debug information in the
	  object files also has only relative paths. Therefore, make
	  sure you cd to the build directory before starting gdb. See
	  the section "COMPILING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTORIES" in the ccache
	  manual for more information.
