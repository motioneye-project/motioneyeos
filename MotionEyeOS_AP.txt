MotionEyeOS Stand-alone Setup
MotionEye has the ability to act as a stand-alone WiFi IP camera, even in a non-networked environment. 
To do so, you need a Raspberry Pi, and MicroSD card, along with a PC to image the SD Card. If you do not have a Pi 3, 3B+, 4B,
or Zero W or Zero WH, you will also need a supported USB WiFi adapter.
Download the latestest stable image of motionEyeOS for the Raspberry Pi you will be using. (as of 17 Feb 2020 it is
20200203)  https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneyeos/releases
Image the SD Card using the tool of your choice. I recommend Win32DiskImager, but Etcher also works in Windows.
Do not remove the SD Card yet. You need to create or copy the following files to the /boot drive:
hostapd.conf , dnsmasq.conf , os.conf , and static_ip.conf . I will include the contents at the end of this tutorial.
If you are using Windows, do not create/edit these files with notepad or wordpad. They create files that aren't quite correct for Linux. I recommend Notepad++, but you can use anything that supports Linux files.
Eject the SD Card, and place it in your Pi. If you are going to use a USB or CSI Camera, attach it. 
Power on the Pi. 
Wait about 2-3 minutes for the first boot and setup.
On your Android Phone, turn on WiFi and connect to 'picam' (if using the settings below in hostapd.conf)
Open the web browser on the phone and go to http://192.168.42.1 (again, if using the settings below in static_ip.conf)
You should get a login. Username is 'admin', password is blank.
You should now be at motionEye screen, with a link to add a camera.
All the normal setup configurations will now work as in the instructions at: https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneyeos/wiki/Configuration
