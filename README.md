**motionEyeOS** is a Linux distribution that turns your single board computer into a video surveillance system. Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneyeos/wiki) for more details.

Due to personal reasons I can no longer be actively involved with this project. If anyone is interested in taking it over, please contact me and we'll work out together a hand-off plan, see also [my last comment about the next plans for this project](https://github.com/motioneye-project/motioneyeos/commit/d816a04b36cd007083955d3149fa4179e8690415#commitcomment-68581119).
