	  gummiboot is a simple UEFI boot manager which executes
	  configured EFI images. The default entry is selected by a
	  configured pattern (glob) or an on-screen menu.

	  gummiboot operates on the EFI System Partition (ESP)
	  only. Configuration file fragments, kernels, initrds, other
	  EFI images need to reside on the ESP. Linux kernels need to
	  be built with CONFIG_EFI_STUB to be able to be directly
	  executed as an EFI image.

	  See the Grub2 help text for details on preparing an EFI
	  capable disk image using Gummiboot: the instructions are
	  exactly the same, except that the Gummiboot configuration
	  files will be located in /loader/ inside the EFI partition.
