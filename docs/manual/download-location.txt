=== Location of downloaded packages

The various tarballs that are downloaded by Buildroot are all stored
in +BR2_DL_DIR+, which by default is the +dl+ directory. If you want
to keep a complete version of Buildroot which is known to be working
with the associated tarballs, you can make a copy of this directory.
This will allow you to regenerate the toolchain and the target
filesystem with exactly the same versions.

If you maintain several Buildroot trees, it might be better to have a
shared download location. This can be achieved by pointing the
+BR2_DL_DIR+ environment variable to a directory.  If this is
set, then the value of +BR2_DL_DIR+ in the Buildroot configuration is
overridden. The following line should be added to +<~/.bashrc>+.

-----------------
 $ export BR2_DL_DIR <shared download location>
-----------------

The download location can also be set in the +.config+ file, with the
+BR2_DL_DIR+ option. Unlike most options in the .config file, this value
is overridden by the +BR2_DL_DIR+ environment variable.
