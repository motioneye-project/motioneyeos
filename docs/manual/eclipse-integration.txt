== Integration with Eclipse

While a part of the embedded Linux developers like classical text
editors like Vim or Emacs, and command-line based interfaces, a number
of other embedded Linux developers like richer graphical interfaces to
do their development work. Eclipse being one of the most popular
Integrated Development Environment, Buildroot integrates with Eclipse
in order to ease the development work of Eclipse users.

Our integration with Eclipse simplifies the compilation, remote
execution and remote debugging of applications and libraries that are
built on top of a Buildroot system. It does not integrate the
Buildroot configuration and build processes themselves with
Eclipse. Therefore, the typical usage model of our Eclipse integration
would be:

* Configure your Buildroot system with +make menuconfig+, +make
  xconfig+ or any other configuration interface provided with
  Buildroot.
* Build your Buildroot system by running +make+.
* Start Eclipse to develop, execute and debug your own custom
  applications and libraries, that will rely on the libraries built
  and installed by Buildroot.

The Buildroot Eclipse integration installation process and usage is
described in detail at
https://github.com/mbats/eclipse-buildroot-bundle/wiki.
