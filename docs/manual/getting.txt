== Getting Buildroot

Buildroot releases are made approximately every 3 months. Direct Git
access and daily snapshots are also available, if you want more
bleeding edge.

Releases are available at http://buildroot.net/downloads/[].

The latest snapshot is always available at
http://buildroot.net/downloads/snapshots/buildroot-snapshot.tar.bz2[],
and previous snapshots are also available at
http://buildroot.net/downloads/snapshots/[].

To download Buildroot using Git, you can simply follow the rules
described on the "Accessing Git" page
(http://buildroot.net/git.html[]) of the Buildroot website
(http://buildroot.net[]).  For the impatient, here's a quick recipe:

---------------------
 $ git clone git://git.buildroot.net/buildroot
