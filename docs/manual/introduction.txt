About Buildroot
===============

Buildroot provides a full featured environment for cross-development.
Buildroot is able to generate a cross-compilation toolchain, a root
filesystem, a Linux kernel image and a bootloader for your target.
Buildroot can be used for any combinaison of these options,
independently.

Buildroot is useful mainly for people working with embedded systems.
Embedded systems often use processors that are not the regular x86
processors everyone is used to having in his PC. They can be PowerPC
processors, MIPS processors, ARM processors, etc.

Buildroot supports numerous processors and their variants; it also
comes with default configuration for several boards available
off-the-shelf. Besides, a number of third-party projects are based on
or develop their BSP footnote:[BSP: Board Software Package] or
SDK footnote:[SDK: Standard Development Kit] on top of Buildroot.
