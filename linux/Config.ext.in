	  Xenomai is split in two parts: a kernel part and a userspace
	  part. Enabling this option automatically selects the Xenomai
	  package and helps in patching the Linux kernel built by
	  Buildroot with the Xenomai kernel part (ie Adeos/Ipipe).

	  You can find the currently supported kernel versions by
	  looking at the available patches in the Xenomai sources
	  tree: ksrc/arch/$(ARCH)/patches

	  However, it is recommended to use the latest version of the
	  Adeos/Ipipe patch available at
	  http://download.gna.org/adeos/patches

	  Xenomai is know to support Blackfin, SH4, x86, ARM, NIOS2
	  and PowerPC architectures.

	  Optionally, explicitly specify the Adeos patch to use.
	  Download it at http://download.gna.org/adeos/patches
	  and verify that your kernel version in buildroot matches.

# RTAI

# fbtft

	bool "FB TFT drivers"
	select BR2_PACKAGE_FBTFT
	help
	  Linux Framebuffer drivers for small TFT LCD display modules,
	  e.g. Adafruit PiTFT displays for Raspberry Pi.

	  To enable fbtft, e.g. for Adafruit 2.8 PiTFT, enable the
	  following kernel configurations:
	  - CONFIG_SPI
	  - CONFIG_GPIOLIB
	  - CONFIG_FB
	  - CONFIG_FB_TFT
	  - CONFIG_FB_TFT_ILI9341
