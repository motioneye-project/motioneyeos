	  CIP launched in the spring of 2016 to address the needs of
	  organizations in industries such as power generation and
	  distribution, water, oil and gas, transportation, building
	  automation and more for reliable and secure Linux-based
	  embedded systems that can be sustained over a period of
	  10 to as many as 60 years.
	  The project's goal is to provide an open source base layer
	  of industrial-grade software that permits the use and
	  implementation of software building blocks that meet
	  these requirements.

	  The CIP community plans to maintain 4.4 for security and
	  bug fixes for more than 10 years.

	  like http://, ftp://, file:// or scp://.

	  When pointing to a local tarball using file://, you may want to
