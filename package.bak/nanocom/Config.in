	  Nanocom is based upon microcom (http://microcom.port5.com/) but
	  removes the scripting and logging features while introducing support
	  for setting local/remote echo, parity and stop bits. It also follows
	  a more standard command line style using the getopt function.
	  Internally much of the code has been rewritten and reformatted, the
	  menu system in particular is almost entirely different.
