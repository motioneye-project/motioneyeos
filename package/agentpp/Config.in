	  AGENT++ is a set of C++ classes which provides a complete protocol
	  engine and dispatch table for the development of SNMP agents.
	  AGENT++ is a multilingual API which supports SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, and
	  SNMPv3. It provides various C++ classes implementing prototypes for
	  scalar and table SNMP managed objects that can be customized by
	  derivation. Additional classes support the development of proxy
	  agents as well as sending notifications.

	  SNMPv3 support is enabled if SNMP++ enables it.
