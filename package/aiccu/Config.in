	  SixXS Automatic IPv6 Connectivity Client Utility

	  AICCU (Automatic IPv6 Connectivity Client Utility) makes it
	  easy for users to get IPv6 connectivity. After having
	  requested an account, tunnel and optionally a subnet, AICCU
	  can be used to automatically configure the tunnel. AICCU
	  supports TIC (Tunnel Information & Control protocol), which it
	  uses for retrieving the tunnel configuration information,
	  AYIYA, which allows tunnels to be created even behind
	  firewalls and NAT's.
