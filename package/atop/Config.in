	  Atop is an ASCII full-screen performance monitor for Linux
	  that is capable of reporting the activity of all processes
	  (even if processes have finished during the interval), daily
	  logging of system and process activity for long-term analysis,
	  highlighting overloaded system resources by using colors, etc.
	  At regular intervals, it shows system-level activity related
	  to the CPU, memory, swap, disks (including LVM) and network
	  layers, and for every process (and thread) it shows e.g. the
	  CPU utilization, memory growth, disk utilization, priority,
	  username, state, and exit code.
