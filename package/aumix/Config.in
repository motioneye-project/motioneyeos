	  aumix is a small, easy-to-use program to control the mixer
	  of your sound card. It runs in text mode using the ncurses
	  library, or from the command line (non-interactively).
	  It can read default settings from a file, and it can also
	  automatically save and restore the mixer settings at shutdown
	  and boot.
