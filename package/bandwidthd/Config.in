	  BandwidthD - Bandwidth monitoring

	  Provides a method to measure the bandwidth that travels
	  through the machine, grouped by subnet and IP. This
	  information can be stored locally in /var/lib/bandwidthd and
	  can be configured to generate static HTML pages which can be
	  hosted by a web server.

	  It is highly recommended that the target has some way of
	  retaining the time between reboots. (e.g. NTP on boot or an
	  RTC)

	  It is suggested to use sqlite for logfile storage but works
	  fine without, and can be completely ignored if the
	  postgresql portion is used.

	  As upstream is no longer actively maintained, a fork is
	  available on github that works on making BandwidthD's build
	  process more compatible with buildroot's.

	  Upstream: http://bandwidthd.sourceforge.net/
	  Github fork: http://github.com/nroach44/bandwidthd

	  Enable support for logging the bandwidthd data to a remote
	  (or local) postgresql server. This data can then be viewed
	  through a php site. See README in the source code
	  (github.com/nroach44/bandwidthd) for more information.
