	  Biosdevname is a udev helper that looks at various BIOS tables to
	  figure out what the actual hardware names are for Ethernet ports
	  and renames the ports accordingly.  This has the advantage of
	  always referring to the same port regardless of system or
	  hardware changes that might otherwise alter the typical ethX
	  naming.
