	  bluez utils version 5.x

	  With this release BlueZ only supports the new Bluetooth
	  Management kernel interface (introduced in Linux 3.4).

	  For Low Energy support at least kernel version 3.5 is
	  needed.

	  The API is not backward compatible with BlueZ 4.

	  Bluez utils will use systemd and/or udev if enabled.
