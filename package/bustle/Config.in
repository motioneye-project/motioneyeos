	  Bustle is a better dbus-monitor! It records and draws
	  sequence diagrams of D-Bus activity, showing signal
	  emissions, method calls and their corresponding returns,
	  with timestamps for each individual event and the duration
	  of each method call. This can help you check for unwanted
	  D-Bus traffic, and pinpoint why your D-Bus-based application
	  isn't performing as well as you like.

	  This only installs the command line bustle-pcap tool, not
	  the graphical viewer.

comment "bustle requires a toolchain with WCHAR support and threading support"
