	  The CELT ultra-low delay audio codec
	  
	  The CELT codec is a compression algorithm for audio. Like MP3,
	  Vorbis, and AAC it is suitable for transmitting music with high
	  quality. Unlike these formats CELT imposes very little delay on
	  the signal, even less than is typical for speech centric formats
	  like Speex, GSM, or G.729.
	  
	  Note: this is version 0.5.1.3 of celt.
