Subject: [PATCH] mbox: do not use backtrace if using uClibc without backtrace
 support

Since uClibc can be configured without support for backtrace, disable
the backtrace if we are building with a uClibc that was built without
backtrace.

This is a bit hacky, and would greatly benefit from a test in ./configure
instead, but does nicely as a quick fix for now.
