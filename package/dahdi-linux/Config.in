	  DAHDI (Digium/Asterisk Hardware Device Interface) is the open
	  source device interface technology used to control Digium and
	  other legacy telephony interface cards.

	  DAHDI Linux is the open source device driver framework used to
	  interface Asterisk with telephony hardware.

	  Note: DAHDI Linux drivers won't build on a kernel v4.0 or more
	  recent, because they use internals that have been removed in
	  v4.0.
