	  Dehydrated is a client for signing certificates with an
	  ACME-server (e.g. Let's Encrypt) implemented as a relatively
	  simple (zsh-compatible) bash-script. This client supports
	  both ACME v1 and the new ACME v2 including support for
	  wildcard certificates!

	  To use this script in Buildroot:
	    - Create /etc/dehydrated/domains.txt
	    - Make sure that "dehydrated -c" is called regularly, e.g.
	      from cron.
	    - Make sure /etc/dehydrated is writable.
	    - Configure the webserver to export the WELLKNOWN directory
	      (/var/www/dehydrated) as /.well-known/acme-challenge
	    - Configure the webserver to use the certificates under
	      /etc/dehydrated/certs/<domain>
	    - Register a HOOK to reload the webserver after the
	      certificates have been renewed.

	  You probably need to install a custom /etc/dehydrated/config
	  with the rootfs overlay.
