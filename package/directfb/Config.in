	  DirectFB (Direct Frame Buffer) is a set of graphics APIs implemented
	  on top of the Linux Frame Buffer (fbdev) abstraction layer. It is an
	  alternative to X11 with a smaller memory footprint that still has an
	  integrated windowing system. As of 4 October 2015, DirectFB's website
	  http://www.directfb.org/ is down. See alternative site listed below.
