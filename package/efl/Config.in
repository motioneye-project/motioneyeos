	help
	  If you have chosen to disable physics support, this disables
	  lots of core functionality and is effectively never
	  tested. You are going to find features that suddenly don't
	  work and as a result cause a series of breakages. This is
	  simply not tested so you are on your own in terms of
	  ensuring everything works if you do this.

	help
	  Eeze is EFL's hardware abstraction layer on top of udev.
	  Having it off will disable some hardware detection, such as

	  removable media.

config BR2_PACKAGE_EFL_FONTCONFIG
	bool "Enable fontconfig support (recommended)"
	default y
	select BR2_PACKAGE_FONTCONFIG
	help
	  If fontconfig is disabled, this is going to make general
	  font searching not work, and only some very direct 'load
	  /path/file.ttf' will work alongside some old-school ttf file
	  path searching. This is very likely not what you want, so
	  highly reconsider turning fontconfig off. Having it off will
	  lead to visual problems like missing text in many UI areas
	  etc...

	default y
	select BR2_PACKAGE_GSTREAMER1
	select BR2_PACKAGE_GST1_PLUGINS_BASE

config BR2_PACKAGE_EFL_LIBFRIBIDI

	default y
	select BR2_PACKAGE_LIBFRIBIDI
	help
	  Fribidi is used for handling right-to-left text (like
	  Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi, Persian etc.) and is very likely not
	  a feature you want to disable unless you know for absolute
	  certain you will never encounter and have to display such
	  scripts. Also note that we don't test with fribidi disabled
	  so you may also trigger code paths with bugs that are never
	  normally used.

config BR2_PACKAGE_EFL_LIBSNDFILE

	  If you disabled audio support in Ecore, this is not tested

	default y
	select BR2_PACKAGE_PULSEAUDIO
	help
	  The only audio output method supported by Ecore right now is
	  via Pulseaudio. You have disabled that and likely have
	  broken a whole bunch of things in the process. Reconsider
