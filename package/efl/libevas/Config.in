config BR2_PACKAGE_LIBEVAS_SCALE_SAMPLE
	bool "libevas sampling scaler"
	help
	  This enables the sampling scaler code. This is the fastest
	  image scaling code, but also the lowest quality.

config BR2_PACKAGE_LIBEVAS_SCALE_SMOOTH
	bool "libevas smooth scaler"
	help
	  This is the nicest looking scaler that is not that much
	  slower than tri-linear, but it looks really good.

config BR2_PACKAGE_LIBEVAS_SMALL_DITHERING
	bool "libevas small dithering"
	help
	  This uses a 4x4 dither mask instead of 128x128. On desktop
	  boxes these days (Pentium, Pentium2, amd etc.) the speed
	  difference is not really measurable, but the quality of the
	  128x128 dither mask is quite a lot better.
