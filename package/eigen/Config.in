	  Eigen is a C++ template library for linear algebra: vectors,
	  matrices, and related algorithms. It is versatile, fast,
	  elegant and works on many platforms (OS/Compilers).

	  This package only installs header files to the include path.
	  If you just want to use Eigen, you can use the header files
	  right away. There is no binary to link to. Eigen is a pure
	  template library defined in the headers.
