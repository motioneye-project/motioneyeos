	  Erlang is a programming language used to build massively
	  scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on high
	  availability. Some of its uses are in telecoms, banking,
	  e-commerce, computer telephony and instant messaging.
	  Erlang's runtime system has built-in support for
	  concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance.
