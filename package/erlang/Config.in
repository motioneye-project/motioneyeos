	  Erlang is a programming language used to build massively scalable
	  soft real-time systems with requirements on high availability.
	  Some of its uses are in telecoms, banking, e-commerce, computer
	  telephony and instant messaging. Erlang's runtime system has
	  built-in support for concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance.

config BR2_PACKAGE_ERLANG_SMP
	bool "enable SMP support"
	help
	  Erlang provides both a UP and an SMP emulator. The UP emulator
	  is always built, and this option enables compilation of the SMP
	  emulator. The choice of which emulator to use is made at runtime.
	  If you do not need SMP support, turning this option off reduces
	  compile time and the size of the Erlang installation.

config BR2_PACKAGE_ERLANG_MEGACO
	bool "install megaco application"
	help
	  The Megaco application is a framework for building applications
	  on top of the Megaco/H.248 protocol. It is approximately 14MB in
	  size so if you do not need it then it is recommended not to
	  enable it.
