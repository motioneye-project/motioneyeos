	  By default, when this option is left empty, Buildroot
	  generates a configuration file for exim with reasonable
	  settings.

	  If you want to override the configuration file generated by
	  Buildroot with a customized file, set here the path to your
	  configuration file with this option.

	  This file shall comply with the syntax defined in the exim
	  documentation (http://www.exim.org/docs.html).
	  Buildroot will generate a configuration file composed of the
	  content of the file you provide plus the toolchain-related
	  settings needed for cross-compilation.
