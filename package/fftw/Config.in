	  Library for computing Fast Fourier Transforms.

	  This library computes Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) in one
	  or more dimensions.  It is extremely fast. This package
	  contains the shared library version of the fftw libraries in
	  double precision.

config BR2_PACKAGE_FFTW_PRECISION_SINGLE
	bool "single"
	help
	  Compile fftw in single precision, i.e. use 'float' for floating
	  point type.

config BR2_PACKAGE_FFTW_PRECISION_DOUBLE
	bool "double"
	help
	  Compile fftw in double precision (the default), i.e. use 'double'
	  for floating point type.

	  Compile fftw in long double precision, i.e. use 'long double'
	  for floating point type.

	  floating point type.

config BR2_PACKAGE_FFTW_FAST
	bool "optimise for speed over accuracy"
	help
	  Optimise for fast math functions, at the expense of accuracy.

	  Say 'y' if you need speed and can live with inaccuracies in
	  the results. Say 'n' (the default) if accuracy is of utmost
	  importance.

	  This basically uses gcc's -Ofast optimisation level, which in
	  turn is basically using gcc's -ffast-math. See the gcc manual
	  for what this means.
