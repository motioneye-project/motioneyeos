	  The Frame Manager Configuration tool is Freescale PowerPC platform
	  software package whose primary purpose is converting
	  Parse-Classify-Police-Distribute (PCD) descriptions of network
	  packets flow into hardware configuration. The tool provides an
	  abstraction layer between the end customer's vision of the PCD task
	  definition and real hardware implementation.
