	  Userspace libraries for Vivante GPU on i.MX6 platforms

	  It contains libraries and headers for GLES, OpenCL, and
	  OpenVG.  It also contains a DRI plugin for X11. It also
	  contains a plugin for DirectFB-1.4.0, but that doesn't work
	  together with buildroot's DirectFB version.

	  This library is provided by Freescale as-is and doesn't have
	  an upstream.

	  Copy the Vivante examples to the target.
