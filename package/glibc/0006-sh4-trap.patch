    Build divdi3 only for architecture that required it
    
    As noted in [1], divdi3 object is only exported in a handful ABIs
    (i386, m68k, powerpc32, s390-32, and ia64), however it is built
    for all current architectures regardless.
    
    This patch refact the make rules for this object to so only the
    aforementioned architectures that actually require it builds it.
    
    Also, to avoid internal PLT calls to the exported symbol from the
    module, glibc uses an internal header (symbol-hacks.h) which is
    unrequired (and in fact breaks the build for architectures that
    intend to get symbol definitions from libgcc.a).  The patch also
    changes it to create its own header (divdi3-symbol-hacks.h) and
    adjust the architectures that require it accordingly.
    
    I checked the build/check (with run-built-tests=no) on the
    following architectures (which I think must cover all supported
    ABI/builds) using GCC 6.3:
    
    aarch64-linux-gnu
    alpha-linux-gnu
    arm-linux-gnueabihf
    hppa-linux-gnu
    ia64-linux-gnu
    m68k-linux-gnu
    microblaze-linux-gnu
    mips64-n32-linux-gnu
    mips-linux-gnu
    mips64-linux-gnu
    nios2-linux-gnu
    powerpc-linux-gnu
    powerpc-linux-gnu-power4
    powerpc64-linux-gnu
    powerpc64le-linux-gnu
    s390x-linux-gnu
    s390-linux-gnu
    sh4-linux-gnu
    sh4-linux-gnu-soft
    sparc64-linux-gnu
    sparcv9-linux-gnu
    tilegx-linux-gnu
    tilegx-linux-gnu-32
    tilepro-linux-gnu
    x86_64-linux-gnu
    x86_64-linux-gnu-x32
    i686-linux-gnu
    
    I only saw one regression on sparcv9-linux-gnu (extra PLT call to
    .udiv) which I address in next patch in the set.  It also correctly
    build SH with GCC 7.0.1 (without any regression from c89721e25d).
