	  gpgv2 is an OpenPGP signature verification tool.

	  This program is actually a stripped-down version of gpg
	  which is only able to check signatures. It is somewhat
	  smaller than the fully-blown gpg and uses a different (and
	  simpler) way to check that the public keys used to make the
	  signature are valid. There are no configuration files and
	  only a few options are implemented.
