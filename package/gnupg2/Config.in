	  GnuPG is the GNU project's complete and free implementation
	  of the OpenPGP standard as defined by RFC4880. GnuPG allows
	  to encrypt and sign your data and communication, features a
	  versatile key management system as well as access modules
	  for all kinds of public key directories. GnuPG, also known
	  as GPG, is a command line tool with features for easy
	  integration with other applications.

	  gpgv2 is an OpenPGP signature verification tool.

	  This program is actually a stripped-down version of gpg
	  which is only able to check signatures. It is somewhat
	  smaller than the fully-blown gpg and uses a different (and
	  simpler) way to check that the public keys used to make the
	  signature are valid. There are no configuration files and
	  only a few options are implemented.
