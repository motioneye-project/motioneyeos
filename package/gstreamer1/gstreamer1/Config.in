config BR2_PACKAGE_GSTREAMER1_PARSE
	bool "enable command-line parser"

	  Enable command line parser for gstreamer. This may increase the CPU
	  overhead by a small amount.

config BR2_PACKAGE_GSTREAMER1_TRACE
	bool "enable tracing subsystem"
	default y
	help
	  Enable the tracing subsystem within gstreamer. This may increase CPU
	  overhead by a small amount.

config BR2_PACKAGE_GSTREAMER1_GST_DEBUG
	bool "enable gst-debug trace support"
	default y
	help
	  Enable support for the gst-debug tracing functionality in gstreamer.
	  This has limited CPU overhead, but does increase the rootfs size
	  somewhat.

config BR2_PACKAGE_GSTREAMER1_PLUGIN_REGISTRY
	bool "enable plugin registry"
	default y
	help
	  Enable support for the GStreamer plugin registry. This may increase

	bool "install gst-launch & gst-inspect"
	default y
	help
	  Install the gst-launch and gst-inspect tools. This will take up
	  additional space on the target.
