	  Google's framework for writing C++ tests on a variety of
	  platforms (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, Cygwin, Windows CE, and
	  Symbian). Based on the xUnit architecture. Supports
	  automatic test discovery, a rich set of assertions,
	  user-defined assertions, death tests, fatal and non-fatal
	  failures, value- and type-parameterized tests, various
	  options for running the tests, and XML test report
	  generation.

	  Gtest also allows to easily build testsuites for C programs.

	  This package allows running testsuites on the target which
	  might be advantageous in certain cases.

	help
	  Inspired by jMock, EasyMock, and Hamcrest, and designed with
	  C++'s specifics in mind, Google C++ Mocking Framework (or
	  Google Mock for short) is a library for writing and using C++
	  mock classes.

	  Google Mock:

	    * lets you create mock classes trivially using simple
	      macros, supports a rich set of matchers and actions,
	    * handles unordered, partially ordered, or completely
	      ordered expectations,
	    * is extensible by users, and
	    * works on Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, Windows Mobile, minGW,
	      and Symbian.

	  There are both host and target packages. The target one has
	  include files required to compile the tests and the static
	  libraries required to link/run them. The host package installs
	  gmock_gen, a Python script used to generate code mocks.
