	  Google's framework for writing C++ tests on a variety of
	  platforms (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, Cygwin, Windows CE, and
	  Symbian). Based on the xUnit architecture. Supports
	  automatic test discovery, a rich set of assertions,
	  user-defined assertions, death tests, fatal and non-fatal
	  failures, value- and type-parameterized tests, various
	  options for running the tests, and XML test report
	  generation.

	  Gtest also allows to easily build testsuites for C programs.

	  This package allows running testsuites on the target which
	  might be advantageous in certain cases.
