	  Hiawatha is a webserver for Unix and has been built with
	  security in mind. This resulted in a highly secure
	  webserver, in both code and features.

	  This webserver runs on Linux, BSD, MacOS X and
	  Windows. Although it can run any kind of CGI / FastCGI
	  application, it has been optimized for usage with PHP. Most
	  well known PHP frameworks and CMS applications have been
	  tested with Hiawatha and ran without a problem. Hiawatha
	  supports many web and HTTP features such as CGI/FastCGI,
	  HTTP authentication, virtual host support, request
	  pipelining, keep alive connections, URL rewriting and many
	  more.
