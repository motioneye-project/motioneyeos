	  Httping is like 'ping' but for http-requests.
	  Give it an url, and it'll show you how long it takes to connect,
	  send a request and retrieve the reply (only the headers).
	  Be aware that the transmission across the network also takes time!
	  So it measures the latency of the webserver + network.
