	  Ifplugd is a daemon which will automatically configure your
	  ethernet device when a cable is plugged in and automatically
	  de-configure it if the cable is pulled out. This is useful
	  on laptops with onboard network adapters, since it will only
	  configure the interface when a cable is really connected.
