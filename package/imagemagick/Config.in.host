	  ImageMagick(R) is a software suite to create, edit, and
	  compose bitmap images. It can read, convert and write images
	  in a variety of formats (about 100) including DPX, EXR, GIF,
	  JPEG, JPEG-2000, PDF, PhotoCD, PNG, Postscript, SVG, and TIFF.
	  Use ImageMagick to translate, flip, mirror, rotate, scale,
	  shear and transform images, adjust image colors, apply various
	  special effects, or draw text, lines, polygons, ellipses and
	  Bézier curves.

	bool "SVG support"
	help
	  Say 'y' here is you need ImageMagick tools (like convert)
	  to support SVG.

	  This is not enabled by default, as it brings quite a few
	  extra dependencies, and thus extra build time.
