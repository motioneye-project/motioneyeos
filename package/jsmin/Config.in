	  JSMin is a filter which removes comments and unnecessary
	  whitespace from JavaScript files. It typically reduces
	  filesize by half, resulting in faster downloads. It also
	  encourages a more expressive programming style because it
	  eliminates the download cost of clean, literate
	  self-documentation.
