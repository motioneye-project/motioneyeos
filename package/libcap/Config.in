	  Install setcap, getcap, getpcaps and capsh tools.

	  For these tools to run properly, you should enable, in your
	  kernel configuration, extended file attributes/security labels
	  support for the file system type used on target system (e.g.
	  CONFIG_EXT2_FS_XATTR and CONFIG_EXT2_FS_SECURITY for ext2).
