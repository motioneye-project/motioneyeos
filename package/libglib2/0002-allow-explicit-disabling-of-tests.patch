Subject: [PATCH] allow explicit disabling of tests

Upstream won't build tests when cross-compiling. However; this means still
building the tests during a host build. Building the tests causes build
failures on older distributions such as CentOS 6 and Debian 7 because the
command `objcopy --add-symbol` is used when building the test
"test_resources2," which is not available with the older version of objcopy
provided by the distributions.

Instead, remove the conditional checks which set build_tests and only check if
installed_tests_enabled is passed.
