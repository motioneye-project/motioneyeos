	  This is a parser for HTTP messages written in C. It
	  parses both requests and responses. The parser is
	  designed to be used in performance HTTP applications.
	  It does not make any syscalls nor allocations, it does
	  not buffer data, it can be interrupted at anytime.
	  Depending on your architecture, it only requires about
	  40 bytes of data per message stream (in a web server
	  that is per connection).
