	  The libphidget library provides an API for controlling Phidgets
	  USB devices. The library translates API function calls to libusb
	  function calls to control attached Phidgets devices that provide
	  GPIO's, DAC's, accelerometers, servo motors, and other capabilities
	  either singly or on combo devices.

	  To use libphidget for controlling locally attached devices you
	  need to set up the userspace USB device tree /dev/bus/usb. See
	  file udev/99-phidgets.rules.

	  The libphidget library also contains an API for sending commands
	  to a local or remote phidgetwebservice using HTTP. The
	  phidgetwebservice then translates HTTP requests to libphidget API
	  function calls to control locally attached Phidgets devices.
