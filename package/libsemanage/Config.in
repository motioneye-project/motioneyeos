	  libsemanage is the policy management library. It uses
	  libsepol for binary policy manipulation and libselinux for
	  interacting with the SELinux system. It also exec's helper
	  programs for loading policy and for checking whether the
	  file_contexts configuration is valid (load_policy and
	  setfiles from policycoreutils) presently, although this may
	  change at least for the bootstrapping case (for rpm).
