	help
	  The purpose of libspatialindex is to provide:

	  * An extensible framework that will support robust spatial
	    indexing methods.

	  * Support for sophisticated spatial queries. Range, point
	    location, nearest neighbor and k-nearest neighbor as well
	    as parametric queries (defined by spatial constraints)
	    should be easy to deploy and run.

	  * Easy to use interfaces for inserting, deleting and updating
	    information.

	  * Wide variety of customization capabilities. Basic index and
	    storage characteristics like the page size, node capacity,
	    minimum fan-out, splitting algorithm, etc. should be easy
	    to customize.

	  * Index persistence. Internal memory and external memory
	    structures should be supported. Clustered and non-clustered
	    indices should be easy to be persisted.
