	  Install the xslt library which is used
	  to transform XML files to other XML files.

	  XSLT is designed for use as part of XSL,
	  which is a stylesheet language for XML.
	  In addition to XSLT, XSL includes an XML vocabulary
	  for specifying formatting.
	  XSL specifies the styling of an XML document by using XSLT
	  to describe how the document is transformed into another
	  XML document that uses the formatting vocabulary.
