	help
	  cpupower is a collection of tools to examine and tune power
	  saving related features of your processor.

config BR2_PACKAGE_LINUX_TOOLS_GPIO
	bool "gpio"
	select BR2_PACKAGE_LINUX_TOOLS
	help
	  gpio is a collection of tools to get information about,
	  control and monitor gpios present on system.

	  These tools use new gpio ABI which will deprecate sysfs gpio
	  interface in the future.

	  These tools are available only from kernel version 4.8.

config BR2_PACKAGE_LINUX_TOOLS_IIO
	bool "iio"
	select BR2_PACKAGE_LINUX_TOOLS
	help
	  iio is a collection of tools to get information about,
	  control and monitor iio devices present on system.

	  These tools are available only from kernel version 4.7.

config BR2_PACKAGE_LINUX_TOOLS_PERF
	bool "perf"
	select BR2_PACKAGE_LINUX_TOOLS
	help
	  perf (sometimes "Perf Events" or perf tools, originally
	  "Performance Counters for Linux") - is a performance
	  analyzing tool in Linux, available from kernel version
	  2.6.31. User-space controlling utility, called 'perf' has
	  git-like interface with subcommands. It is capable of
	  statistical profiling of entire system (both kernel and user
	  code), single CPU or severals threads.

	  This will build and install the userspace 'perf'
	  command.

	  Your kernel must have CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS enabled to use perf
	  profiling. Buildroot automatically enables this in the kernel
	  configuration.

	select BR2_PACKAGE_POPT
	select BR2_PACKAGE_LIBCAP_NG
	help
	  Build and install (to /usr/lib/kselftests) kernel selftests.

	  Use of this option implies you know the process of using and
	  compiling the kernel selftests. The Makefile to build and
	  install these is very noisy and may appear to cause your
	  build to fail for strange reasons.

	  This is very much a use at your risk option and may not work
	  for every setup or every architecture.
