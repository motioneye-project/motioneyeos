	  The Linux PTP Project is the Precision Time Protocol
	  implementation according to IEEE standard 1588 for Linux.

	  The dual design goals are to provide a robust implementation
	  of the standard and to use the most relevant and modern
	  Application Programming Interfaces (API) offered by the
	  Linux kernel. Supporting legacy APIs and other platforms is
	  not a goal.
