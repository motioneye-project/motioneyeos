	  LIRC is a package that supports receiving and sending IR
	  signals of the most common IR remote controls. It contains a
	  daemon that decodes and sends IR signals, a mouse daemon
	  that translates IR signals to mouse movements and a couple
	  of user programs that allow to control your computer with a
	  remote control.

	  It requires the kernel LIRC interface driver, make sure to
	  enable the kernel drivers to support your hardware.
