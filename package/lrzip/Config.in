	  A compression utility that excels at compressing large files
	  (usually > 10-50 MB). Larger files and/or more free RAM means
	  that the utility will be able to more effectively compress
	  your files (ie: faster / smaller size), especially if the
	  filesize(s) exceed 100 MB. You can either choose to optimise
	  for speed (fast compression / decompression) or size,
	  but not both.
