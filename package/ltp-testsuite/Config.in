	  The Linux Test Project provides a huge testsuite for Linux.

	  The LTP testsuite uses several functions that are considered
	  obsolete, such as sigset() and others. Therefore, the LTP
	  testsuite does not build with Buildroot's default uClibc
	  configuration, and options such as DO_XSI_MATH,
	  UCLIBC_HAS_OBSOLETE_BSD_SIGNAL and UCLIBC_SV4_DEPRECATED
	  are needed.
