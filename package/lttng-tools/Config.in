	  Userspace utilities for the LTTng 2.0 tracing
	  infrastructure.

	  Those utilities are required on the target system to start
	  and stop tracing sessions. Analysis of the trace can be done
	  on the host machine using the babeltrace utility. This
	  utility is automatically built by Buildroot in
	  $(O)/host/usr/bin/babeltrace, as a dependency of
	  lttng-tools. However, there is also a lttng-babeltrace
	  package for the target, if babeltrace on the target is
	  interesting.

	  If userspace tracing is desired, you need to enable
	  lttng-libust.
