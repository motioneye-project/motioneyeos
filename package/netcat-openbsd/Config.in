	  A simple Unix utility which reads and writes data across network
	  connections using TCP or UDP protocol. It is designed to be a
	  reliable "back-end" tool that can be used directly or easily driven
	  by other programs and scripts. At the same time it is a feature-rich
	  network debugging and exploration tool, since it can create almost
	  any kind of connection you would need and has several interesting
	  built-in capabilities.

	  This package contains the OpenBSD rewrite of netcat, including
	  support for IPv6, proxies, and Unix sockets.
