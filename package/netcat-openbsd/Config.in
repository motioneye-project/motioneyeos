	  A simple Unix utility which reads and writes data across
	  network connections using TCP or UDP protocol. It is
	  designed to be a reliable "back-end" tool that can be used
	  directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts. At
	  the same time it is a feature-rich network debugging and
	  exploration tool, since it can create almost any kind of
	  connection you would need and has several interesting
	  built-in capabilities.

	  This package contains the OpenBSD rewrite of netcat,
	  including support for IPv6, proxies, and Unix sockets.
