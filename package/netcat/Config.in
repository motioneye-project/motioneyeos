	  Netcat is a featured networking utility which reads and writes data
	  across network connections, using the TCP/IP protocol.
	  It is designed to be a reliable "back-end" tool that can be used
	  directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts. At the
	  same time, it is a feature-rich network debugging and exploration
	  tool, since it can create almost any kind of connection you would
	  need and has several interesting built-in capabilities.
