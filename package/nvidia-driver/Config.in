	  Two libraries require special agreement with NVidia to
	  develop code linking to those libraries: libnvidia-ifr.so
	  and libnvidia-fbc.so (to grab and encode an OpenGL buffer or
	  an X framebuffer.)

	  Say 'y' here if you plan on running a program that uses
	  those private libraries.

	  Build the nvidia.ko kernel module.

	  If CUDA support (above) is set, and the target is x86_64, then
	  this will also build the nvidia-uvm.ko kernel module, which
	  provides Unified Memory access to the GPU and CPU memories for
	  CUDA programs.
