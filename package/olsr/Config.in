	  The Optimized Link State Routing protocol (OLSR) is a routing protocol that is optimised
	  for mobile ad-hoc networks, sometimes called wireless mesh networks. It is a proactive
	  link-state routing protocol that floods a full topology table to all nodes in the network
	  which then compute optimal forwarding paths locally.
