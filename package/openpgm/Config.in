	  OpenPGM is an open source implementation of the Pragmatic General
	  Multicast (PGM) specification in RFC 3208 available at www.ietf.org.
	  PGM is a reliable and scalable multicast protocol that enables
	  receivers to detect loss, request retransmission of lost data, or
	  notify an application of unrecoverable loss.
