	  openPOWERLINK is an Open Source Industrial Ethernet stack
	  implementing the POWERLINK protocol for Managing Node (MN,
	  POWERLINK Master) and Controlled Node (CN, POWERLINK Slave).

	  It is provided by
	  SYSTEC electronic (http://www.systec-electronic.com),
	  B&R (http://www.br-automation.com) and
	  Kalycito (http://www.kalycito.com).

	  Compile openPOWERLINK application library which contains the
	  interface to a Linux user space driver, and the Linux user
	  space driver. It is used for implementing a multi-process
	  solution where the openPOWERLINK layer is running as a
	  separate Linux user space daemon (i.e. a PCAP based user
	  space daemon).  No kernel-side stack is needed.

	  Compile openPOWERLINK application library which contains the
	  interface to a Linux kernel PCIe interface driver. The kernel
	  part of the openPOWERLINK stack is located on an external PCIe
	  device. The status/control and data exchange between the
	  application and kernel stack is handled by the PCIe interface
	  driver.
