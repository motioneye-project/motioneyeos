Subject: [PATCH] sh/init.sh.Linux.in: change /run/lock from root:uucp to
 root:daemon
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

On gentoo /run/lock is owned by uucp group because of historical
reasons. However uucp does not exist on buildroot by default, and
it makes more sense that 'daemon' group should own this directory.
