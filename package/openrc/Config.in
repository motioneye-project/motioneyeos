	  Init that works on top of pid 1 (for example
	  openrc-init). By default it does quite a lot on startup
	  (like setting hwclock, mounting directories, configuring
	  interfaces and so on). So for this init to properly work you
	  need at least these tools on the root filesystem (default
	  busybox configuration provides them all):

	  swapon, fsck, hwclock, getty, login, grep, mount, coreutils,
	  procps, modprobe (kmod), net-tools

	  Number of tools may be decreased by removing services that
	  use them.
