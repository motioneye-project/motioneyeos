	  Opkg is a lightweight package management system, based on ipkg. It is
	  written in C and resembles apt/dpkg in operation. It is intended for
	  use on embedded Linux devices.
	  Opkg is maintained, stable, robust and conservative in its memory
	  usage, despite its buggy ipkg ancestry. As best it can, opkg
	  maintains backwards compatibility with ipkg and conforms to a subset
	  of debian's policy manual regarding control files.
