	  Pango is a library for laying out and rendering of text, with an
	  emphasis on internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that
	  text layout is needed, though most of the work on Pango so far has
	  been done in the context of the GTK+ widget toolkit. Pango forms the
	  core of text and font handling for GTK+-2.x.
