Subject: [PATCH] Yet another duplicate name bugfix by overestimating the
 memory needed (i.e. another hack - PCRE2 has this "properly" fixed).

14. And yet another buffer overflow bug involving duplicate named groups, this
    time nested, with a nested back reference. Yet again, I have just allowed
    for more memory, because anything more needs all the refactoring that has
    been done for PCRE2. An example pattern that provoked this bug is:
    /((?J)(?'R'(?'R'(?'R'(?'R'(?'R'(?|(\k'R'))))))))/ and the bug was
    registered as CVE-2016-1283.
