	  phidgetwebservice (the Phidget WebService) provides an HTTP
	  front-end to the libphidget device control API. This
	  provides an alternative to the libphidget C linkage
	  interface for controlling locally attached Phidgets USB
	  devices and it also allows you to control Phidget USB
	  devices remotely when the host running the phidgetwebservice
	  has an exposed network interface.

	  The phidgetwebservice client program uses the libphidget
	  HTTP functions to send commands to the phidgetwebservice.
