Allow both shared and static PolarSSL library

By default, PolarSSL is built as a static library. If the option
USE_SHARED_POLARSSL_LIBRARY is set, then it is build as a shared
library. But there is no way of building both the shared and static
versions.

This patch adds the USE_STATIC_POLARSSL_LIBRARY (which defaults to ON)
in addition to the existing USE_SHARED_POLARSSL_LIBRARY (which
defaults to OFF). Both options can be manipulated independently.
