# See src/google/protobuf/stubs/platform_macros.h for supported archs.
#
# On PowerPC, the __atomic_*() built-ins for 1-byte, 2-byte and 4-byte
# types are available built-in. However, the __atomic_*() built-ins for
# 8-byte types is implemented via libatomic, so only available since gcc
# 4.8.
#
# In Buildroot, to simplify things, we've decided to simply require gcc
# 4.8 as soon as the architectures has at least one __atomic_*() built-in
# variant that requires libatomic.
#
# Since protobuf most likely only uses the 1, 2 and 4-byte variants, it
# *could* technically build with gcc 4.7. This is probably not a big deal,
# and we can live with requiring gcc 4.8 on PowerPC to build protobuf.
#
# The SPARC64 build fails due to a missing definition of Atomic64. This
# has been fixed on the master branch but the build still breaks due to
# undefined references to internal NoBarrier_Atomic*() functions.
#
# host-protobuf only builds on certain architectures
