	  PSplash is a userspace graphical boot splash screen for mainly
	  embedded Linux devices supporting a 16bpp or 32bpp framebuffer.
	  It has few dependencies (just libc), supports basic images and
	  text and handles rotation. Its visual look is configurable by
	  basic source changes.

	  Also included is a 'client' command utility for sending
	  information to psplash such as boot progress information.

	  Start the drawing process with 'psplash -n&' as early as possible.
	  Note: psplash creates a FIFO in /tmp for communication with
	  psplash-write.

	  Usage:
	  * Set progress bar to 50 percent:
	    psplash-write "PROGRESS 50"

	  * Display message "foobar" above progress bar:
	    psplash-write "MSG foobar"

	  * Terminate psplash:
	    psplash-write "QUIT"
