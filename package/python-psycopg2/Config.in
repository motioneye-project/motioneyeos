	  Psycopg is the most popular PostgreSQL database adapter for
	  the Python programming language. Its main features are the
	  complete implementation of the Python DB API 2.0 specification
	  and the thread safety (several threads can share the same
	  connection). It was designed for heavily multi-threaded
	  applications that create and destroy lots of cursors and make
	  a large number of concurrent INSERTs or UPDATEs.

	  Psycopg 2 is mostly implemented in C as a libpq wrapper,
	  resulting in being both efficient and secure. It features
	  client-side and server-side cursors, asynchronous
	  communication and notifications, COPY support. Many Python
	  types are supported out-of-the-box and adapted to matching
	  PostgreSQL data types; adaptation can be extended and
	  customized thanks to a flexible objects adaptation system.
	  Psycopg 2 is both Unicode and Python 3 friendly.
