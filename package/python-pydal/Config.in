	  pyDAL is a pure Python Database Abstraction Layer.  It
	  dynamically generates the SQL in real time using the
	  specified dialect for the database back end, so that you do
	  not have to write SQL code or learn different SQL dialects
	  (the term SQL is used generically), and your code will be
	  portable among different types of databases.

	  pyDAL comes from the original web2py's DAL, with the aim of
	  being wide-compatible.  pyDAL doesn't require web2py and can
	  be used in any Python context.
