	  The pyparsing module is an alternative approach to creating and
	  executing simple grammars, vs. the traditional lex/yacc approach,
	  or the use of regular expressions. The pyparsing module provides
	  a library of classes that client code uses to construct the grammar
	  directly in Python code.
