	  Qhull computes the convex hull, Delaunay triangulation,
	  Voronoi diagram, halfspace intersection about a point,
	  furthest-site Delaunay triangulation, and furthest-site
	  Voronoi diagram. The source code runs in 2-d, 3-d, 4-d, and
	  higher dimensions. Qhull implements the Quickhull algorithm
	  for computing the convex hull. It handles roundoff errors
	  from floating point arithmetic. It computes volumes, surface
	  areas, and approximations to the convex hull.
