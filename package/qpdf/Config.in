	  QPDF is a command-line program that does structural, content-
	  preserving transformations on PDF files. It could have been called
	  something like pdf-to-pdf. It also provides many useful capabilities
	  to developers of PDF-producing software or for people who just want
	  to look at the innards of a PDF file to learn more about how they
	  work.
