	  The RocksDB library provides a persistent key value store.
	  Keys and values are arbitrary byte arrays. The keys are
	  ordered within the key value store according to a
	  user-specified comparator function.

	  The library is maintained by the Facebook Database Engineering
	  Team, and is based on LevelDB, by Sanjay Ghemawat and Jeff
	  Dean at Google.
