	  An implementation of the Point-to-point protocol over Ethernet.
	  Has userspace client and server deamons. You likely only need
	  this package if you are implementing the pppoe server that will
	  service other pppoe client devices. Otherwise the normal client
	  functionality already exists in the pppd package (and kernel).
