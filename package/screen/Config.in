	  Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical 
	  terminal between several processes, typically interactive shells. 
	  Each virtual terminal provides the functions of the DEC VT100 
	  terminal and, in addition, several control functions from the ANSI 
	  X3.64 (ISO 6429) and ISO 2022 standards (e.g., insert/delete line 
	  and support for multiple character sets).
