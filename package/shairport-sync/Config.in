	  Shairport Sync emulates an AirPort Express for the purpose of
	  streaming audio from iTunes, iPods, iPhones, iPads and AppleTVs.
	  Audio played by a Shairport Sync-powered device stays in synchrony
	  with the source and thus with other devices that are playing the same
	  source synchronously. Thus, for example, synchronised multi-room
	  audio is possible without difficulty.

	help
	  Enable support for libsoxr, the SoX Resampler library.

	  Briefly, Shairport Sync keeps in step with the audio source by
	  deleting or inserting frames of audio into the stream as needed. This
	  "interpolation" is normally inaudible, but it can be heard in some
	  circumstances. Libsoxr allows this interpolation to be done much more
	  smoothly and subtly.
