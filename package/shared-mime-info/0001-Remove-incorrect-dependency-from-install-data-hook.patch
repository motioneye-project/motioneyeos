Subject: [PATCH] Remove incorrect dependency from install-data-hook

Having install-binPROGRAMS as a dependency of install-data-hook is not
correct, as it causes the installation of programs to be executed
twice, and those two installations are racing with each other, causing
random installation failures.

In addition, this dependency is not needed: the install-data-hook
calls the update-mime-database program in one of two ways:

 - When cross-compiling, using the program pointed by
   UPDATE_MIME_DATABASE, which is already built, and is not installed
   by install-binPROGRAMS.

 - When compiling natively, suing the update-mime-database from the
   build directory, so there is no need to depend on
   install-binPROGRAMS.

This patch is similar to the patch used by the Yocto Project at
http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/poky/plain/meta/recipes-support/shared-mime-info/shared-mime-info/install-data-hook.patch.
