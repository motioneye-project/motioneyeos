	  User space programs and libraries for SMACK.

	  SMACK stands for Simplified Mandatory Access Control Kernel.
	  It is a Linux Security Module which provides a Mandatory Access
	  Control mechanism, aimed towards simplicity.

	  This package provides a library which allows applications to work
	  with SMACK and tools to load/unload rules from the kernel, as well
	  as query the policy.

	  SMACK requires the following kernel options to be enabled:

	  - CONFIG_SECURITY
	  - CONFIG_SECURITY_SMACK
	  - CONFIG_SECURITY_NETWORK

	  These options will be automatically enabled by Buildroot if it is
	  responsible for building the kernel. Otherwise, if you are building
	  your kernel outside of Buildroot, make sure these options are
	  enabled.

	  To activate SMACK, do not forget to add "security=smack" to your
	  kernel command line.
