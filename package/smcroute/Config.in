	  SMCRoute is a command line tool to manipulate the multicast
	  routes of a UNIX kernel. It supports both IPv4 and IPv6 multicast
	  routing. SMCRoute can be used as an alternative to dynamic
	  multicast routers like mrouted or pimd in setups where static
	  multicast routes should be maintained and/or no proper IGMP or
	  MLD signaling exists.
