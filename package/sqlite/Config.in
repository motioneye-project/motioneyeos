config BR2_PACKAGE_SQLITE_READLINE
	bool "Command-line editing"
	select BR2_PACKAGE_NCURSES
	select BR2_PACKAGE_READLINE
	help
	  Enable command-line editing. This requires ncurses and readline.

config BR2_PACKAGE_SQLITE_STAT3
	bool "Additional query optimizations (stat3)"
	help
	  Adds additional logic to the ANALYZE command and to the query
	  planner that can help SQLite to choose a better query plan under
	  certain situations.

config BR2_PACKAGE_SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3
	bool "Enable version 3 of the full-text search engine"
	help
	  When this option is defined in the amalgamation
	  (see http://www.sqlite.org/amalgamation.html), version 3 of
	  the full-text search engine is added to the build automatically.

config BR2_PACKAGE_SQLITE_ENABLE_UNLOCK_NOTIFY
	bool "Enable sqlite3_unlock_notify() interface"
	help
	  This option enables the sqlite3_unlock_notify() interface and its
	  accosiated functionality. See the documentation
	  http://www.sqlite.org/unlock_notify.html for additional information.

config BR2_PACKAGE_SQLITE_SECURE_DELETE
	bool "Set the secure_delete pragma on by default"
	help
	  This compile-time option changes the default settings of the
	  secure_delete pragma. When this option is not used, secure_delete
	  defaults to off. When this option is present, secure_delete defaults
	  to on.

	  The secure_delete setting causes deleted content to be overwritten
	  with zeros. There is a small performance penalty for this since
	  additional I/O must occur. On the other hand, secure_delete can
	  prevent sensitive information from lingering in unused parts
	  of the database file after it has allegedly been deleted.
	  See the documentation on the
	  http://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_secure_delete
	  for additional information.
