	  Sysdig is open source, system-level exploration:
	  capture system state and activity from a running Linux
	  instance, then save, filter and analyze.
	  Think of it as strace + tcpdump + lsof + awesome sauce.
	  With a little Lua cherry on top.

comment "sysdig needs a glibc or uclibc toolchain w/ C++, gcc >= 4.8, dynamic library and a Linux kernel to be built"
