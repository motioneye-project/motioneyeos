	  systemd is a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with
	  SysV and LSB init scripts. systemd provides aggressive parallelization
	  capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services,
	  offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using
	  Linux cgroups, supports snapshotting and restoring of the system
	  state, maintains mount and automount points and implements an
	  elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic.
	  It can work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit.
