	  The Apache Thrift software framework, for scalable cross-language
	  services development, combines a software stack with a
	  code generation engine to build services that work
	  efficiently and seamlessly between C++, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby,
	  Erlang, Perl, Haskell, C#, Cocoa, JavaScript, Node.js, Smalltalk,
	  OCaml and Delphi and other languages.
