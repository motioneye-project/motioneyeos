	  uacme is a client for the ACMEv2 protocol described in
	  RFC8555, written in plain C code with minimal dependencies
	  (libcurl and GnuTLS or mbedTLS). The ACMEv2 protocol allows
	  a Certificate Authority (https://letsencrypt.org is a
	  popular one) and an applicant to automate the process of
	  verification and certificate issuance.
