Subject: [PATCH] libdl: fix dlopen implementation from statically linked
 application

Calling dlopen from statically linked application is actually broken,
because _dl_find_hash enters into an infinite loop when trying to
resolve symbols. In this case it doesn't need to extend the global
scope, it is readyto be used as it is, because _dl_loaded_modules already points
to the dlopened library.

The patch also fixesi a typo in __LDSO_LD_LIBRARY_PATH__ macro, that was
preventing to get the actual value of the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
