	  Micro Name Service Caching Daemon

	  A daemon which handles passwd, group and host lookups for
	  running programs and caches the results for the next query.
	  You only need this package if you are using slow Name Services
	  like LDAP, NIS or NIS+.

	  This particular NSCD is a complete rewrite of the GNU glibc
	  nscd which is a single threaded server process which offloads
	  all NSS lookups to worker children; cache hits are handled by
	  the parent, and only cache misses start worker children,
	  making the parent immune to resource leaks, hangs, and crashes
	  in NSS libraries.

	  It should mostly be a drop-in replacement for existing
	  installs using nscd.
