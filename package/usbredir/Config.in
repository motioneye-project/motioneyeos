	  usbredir is the name of a network protocol for sending usb device
	  traffic over a network connection. It is also the name of the
	  software package offering a parsing library, a usbredirhost library
	  and several utilities implementing this protocol.

	  Note: only the library is installed, not the utilities. Say 'y'
	  below if you want the server too.

	help
	  If you want to serve usbredir requests on your target, say 'y'
	  here to have the usbredir server on the target.

	  Note: the server is not required to use the library.
