	  Weston is the reference implementation of a Wayland
	  compositor, and a useful compositor in its own right.
	  Weston has various backends that lets it run on Linux kernel
	  modesetting and evdev input as well as under X11.

	  This enables the RDP backend, which allows accessing weston
	  through the network with any RDP-compliant client.

	  Please note that one must pass those options to weston for RDP
	  to be functional:
	    --rdp-tls-cert=/path/to/server.crt
	    --rdp-tls-key=/path/to/server.key

	  By default, Buildroot installs such files in /etc/freerdp/server/
	  so you may want to change them in a post-build script or a rootfs
	  overlay.
