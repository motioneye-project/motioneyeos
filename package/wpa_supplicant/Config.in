	  Enable support for nl80211.  This is the current wireless
	  API for Linux, supported by all wireless drivers in vanilla
	  Linux, but may not be supported by some out-of-tree Linux
	  wireless drivers.  wpa_supplicant will still fall back to
	  using the Wireless Extensions (wext) API with these drivers.

	  If this option is disabled, then only the deprecated wext
	  API will be supported, with far less features.  Linux may
	  supports using wext with modern drivers using a
	  compatibility layer, but it must be enabled in the kernel
	  configuration.

	help
	  With this option enabled, wpa_supplicant can act as an
	  access point much like hostapd does with a limited feature set.
	  This links in parts of hostapd functionality into wpa_supplicant,
	  making it bigger but dispensing the need for a separate hostapd
	  binary in some applications hence being smaller overall.
