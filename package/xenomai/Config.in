	  Xenomai is split in two parts: a kernel part and an
	  userspace part.

	  This package contains the userspace part, which consists
	  mainly in libraries to write userspace real-time programs
	  that interact with the in-kernel Xenomai real-time core.

	  For those libraries to work, you need a Xenomai-enabled
	  kernel. This is possible in two ways:
	   - if you compile your kernel with Buildroot, you need to go
	     to Linux Kernel -> Linux Kernel Extensions to enable the
	     Xenomai extension.
	   - if you compile your kernel outside of Buildroot, you need
	     to make sure that it is Xenomai-enabled.

	  Finally, if you are using a static /dev, make sure to
	  uncomment the Xenomai entries listed in
	  target/generic/device_table_dev.txt.
