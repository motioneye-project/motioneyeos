	  XScreenSaver is the standard screen saver collection shipped
	  on most Linux and Unix systems running the X11 Window
	  System.

	  On X11 systems, XScreenSaver is two things: it is both a
	  large collection of screen savers; and it is also the
	  framework for blanking and locking the screen.
