	  XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
	  compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
	  compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.

	  This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ
	  compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on. They can
	  also handle the older LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate
	  symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma
	  package.
