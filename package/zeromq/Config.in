	  ØMQ (ZeroMQ, 0MQ, zmq) looks like an embeddable networking
	  library but acts like a concurrency framework. It gives you
	  sockets that carry whole messages across various transports
	  like in-process, inter- process, TCP, and multicast. You can
	  connect sockets N-to-N with patterns like fanout, pub-sub,
	  task distribution, and request-reply.  It's fast enough to
	  be the fabric for clustered products. Its asynchronous I/O
	  model gives you scalable multicore applications, built as
	  asynchronous message-processing tasks. It has a score of
	  language APIs and runs on most operating systems.

	  ØMQ is from iMatix and is LGPL open source.

	  Add support for Pragmatic General Multicast protocol (RFC 3208)
	  implemented either over raw IP packets or UDP datagrams
	  (encapsulated PGM). This requires OpenPGM library.
