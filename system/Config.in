config BR2_TARGET_GENERIC_PASSWD_DES

	  Use standard 56-bit DES-based crypt(3) to encode passwords.

	  brute-force attacks.

config BR2_TARGET_GENERIC_PASSWD_MD5
	bool "md5"
	help
	  Use MD5 to encode passwords.

	  The default. Wildly available, and pretty good.
	  Although pretty strong, MD5 is now an old hash function, and
	  suffers from some weaknesses, which makes it susceptible to
	  brute-force attacks.

config BR2_TARGET_GENERIC_PASSWD_SHA256
	bool "sha-256"
	help
	  Use SHA256 to encode passwords.

	  Very strong, but not ubiquitous, although available in glibc
	  for some time now. Choose only if you are sure your C library
	  understands SHA256 passwords.

config BR2_TARGET_GENERIC_PASSWD_SHA512
	bool "sha-512"
	help
	  Use SHA512 to encode passwords.

	  Extremely strong, but not ubiquitous, although available in glibc

	  This can for example be used to call a tool building a
	  firmware image from different images generated by Buildroot,
	  or automatically extract the tarball root filesystem image
	  into some location exported by NFS, or any other custom
	  action.

	  These scripts are called with the images directory name as

	  source directory as the current directory.

	  scripts.

	  Note that all the post-build and post-image scripts will be passed
	  the same set of arguments, you can not pass different arguments to
	  each script.

	  Note also, as stated in their respective help text, that the first
	  argument to each post-build or post-image script is the target
	  directory / images directory. The arguments in this option will be
	  passed *after* those.
