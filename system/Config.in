	  Any other value is taken to be a clear-text value, and is crypt-encoded
	  as per the "Passwords encoding" scheme, above.

	  Note: "$" signs in the hashed password must be doubled. For example,
	  if the hashed password is "$1$longsalt$v35DIIeMo4yUfI23yditq0",

	  .config file or the build log may be distributed, or at the
	  very least use a strong cryptographic hash for your password!
