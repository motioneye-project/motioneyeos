	  Build a cloop root filesystem
	  cloop is a Linux kernel module that enables compressed loopback filesystem
	  support.  With it you can mount a compressed filesystem like a block device
	  and seamlessly decompress its data while accessing it.  The majority of the
	  software on an LNX-BBC is accessed in this fashion.
