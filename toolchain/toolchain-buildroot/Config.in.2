comment "Toolchain Options"

config BR2_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT_LARGEFILE
	bool "Enable large file (files > 2 GB) support"
	select BR2_LARGEFILE
	help
	  Enable this option if you want your toolchain to support
	  files bigger than 2 GB.

config BR2_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT_INET_IPV6
	bool "Enable IPv6 support"
	select BR2_INET_IPV6
	help
	  Enable this option if you want your toolchain to support
	  IPv6.

config BR2_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT_INET_RPC
	bool "Enable RPC support"
	select BR2_INET_RPC
	help
	  Enable this option if you want your toolchain to support
	  RPC (needed for NFS, for example).

config BR2_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT_WCHAR
	bool "Enable WCHAR support"
	select BR2_USE_WCHAR
	help
	  Enable this option if you want your toolchain to support
	  wide characters (i.e characters longer than 8 bits, needed
	  for locale support).

config BR2_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT_LOCALE
	bool "Enable toolchain locale/i18n support"
	select BR2_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT_WCHAR
	select BR2_ENABLE_LOCALE
	help
	  Enable this option if you want your toolchain to support
	  localization and internationalization.

config BR2_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT_PROGRAM_INVOCATION
	bool "Enable 'program invocation name' support"
	select BR2_PROGRAM_INVOCATION
	help
	  Enable this option if you want your toolchain to support the
	  GNU-specific program_invocation_name and
	  program_invocation_short_name strings.  Some GNU packages
	  (like tar and coreutils) utilize these for extra useful
	  output, but in general are not required.

config BR2_VFP_FLOAT
	bool "Use ARM Vector Floating Point unit"
	depends on !BR2_SOFT_FLOAT
	depends on BR2_arm || BR2_armeb
	help
	  Setting this option will enable the "-mfpu=vfp" option.
	  If your ARM CPU has a Vector Floating Point Unit (VFP)
	  and the toolchain supports the option, then the
	  code can be optimized.

	  Most people will answer N.

config BR2_CROSS_TOOLCHAIN_TARGET_UTILS
	bool "Include target utils in cross toolchain"
	default y
	help
	  When using buildroot to build a deployable cross toolchain,
	  it is handy to include certain target apps with that toolchain
	  as a convenience.
	  Examples include ldd, gdbserver, and strace.

	  Answer Y if you want these apps (if built) copied into the
	  cross toolchain dir under <arch>-linux-uclibc/target_utils/.
